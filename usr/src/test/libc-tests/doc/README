--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. What this Unit Test Suite tests

This Unit Test Suite is for testing various libc interfaces.

2. Building and installing this Unit Test Suite

This Test Suite runs under the testrunner framework (which can be installed
as pkg:/system/test/testrunner). To build both this Unit Test Suite and the
testrunner without running a full nightly:

	build_machine$ bldenv [-d] <your_env_file>
	build_machine$ cd $SRC/test
	build_machine$ dmake install
	build_machine$ cd $SRC/pkg
	build_machine$ dmake install

Then set the publisher on the test machine to point to your repository and
install the Utils Unit Test Suite.

	test_machine# pkg install pkg:/system/test/libctest

Note, the framework will be installed automatically, as this test suite
depends on it.

Additionally some text locales are required, specifically, en_US.UTF-8,
de_DE.UTF-8, ja_JP.UTF-8, and ru_RU.UTF-8.  Again, these are listed as
dependencies and will be automatically installed.

3. Running this Unit Test Suite

The pre-requisites for running the this Unit Test Suite are:
	- Any user may perform these tests.
	- The en_US.UTF-8, ja_JP.UTF-8, de_DE.UTF-8, and ru_RU.UTF-8 locales
          must be installed.

Once the pre-requisites are satisfied, simply run the ostest script:

	test_machine$ /opt/util-tests/bin/libctest

4. Test results

While the Unit Test Suite is running, one informational line is printed at
the end of each test, and a results summary is printed at the end of the run.
The results summary includes the location of the complete logs, which is of the
form /var/tmp/test_results/<ISO 8601 date>.
