#
# This Makefile provides a framework for building the onbld python
# modules with multiple versions of python.
#
# It expects as input:
#
#    PYSRCS   - List of python source files, these are also delivered as
#               build product.
#	      
#    PYOBJS   - List of compiled python (.pyc) files, with no directory prefix
#	      
#    PYTOPDIR - Absolute (including $(ROOT)) path to which files will
#               be installed, up until the version specific component.
#	      
#    PYMODDIR - Relative path to which files will be installed, below
#               the version specific component.
#
#    For example, to install to /opt/onbld/lib/onbld/python*/bar/
#
#          PYTOPDIR = $(ROOTONBLDLIB)
#          PYMODDIR = bar
#
#
# It provides as output:
#
#    ROOTPYFILES - The list of $(ROOT)-relative paths to which python
#                  source and binary files will be installed.  Your
#                  Makefile's 'install' target should depend upon
#                  this.
#
#    PYVERSOBJS  - The list of paths to compiled python build products,
#                  including their subdirectory.
#
#    pyclobber   - A target on which 'clobber' should depend, which
#                  removes the per-version python directories and the
#                  output within them.
