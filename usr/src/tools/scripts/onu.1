.SH NAME
.I onu
\- Os/Net Update
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBonu [-e <URI> [-E <publisher>]] [ -O ] [-s <beName>] -t <beName> [-u <URI> [-U <publisher>]] [-vZ]\fP
.br
\fBonu [-d <dir>] [ -O ] [-s <beName>] -t <beName> [-vZ]\fP
.LP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX "OS-Net build tools" "onu" "" "\fBonu\fP"
.LP
.I onu 
is a replacement for
.I bfu
used to update a system with the latest set of IPS packages for the ON
(OS/Net) consolidation of Solaris, using beadm(1M) to create a new Boot
Environment (BE) and pkg(1) to update the image.
.LP
Former users of bfu should note the following ways in which onu behaves
differently from bfu.  First, as noted above, onu creates a new BE, rather
than updating an existing BE in-place.  Second, onu will not install packages
that are older than what is already installed in the source BE.  Third,
conflicts in system configuration files are automatically resolved according
to the files' "preserve" attribute, as described in pkg(5).
.SH OPTIONS
.LP
The following options are supported:
.TP 4
.B \-d <dir>
Specifies that <dir> contains repo.redist and repo.extra sub-directories;
.I onu
will stand up a depot for each and use them for the publisher and extra
packaging repositories.  Note that -d overrides -u, -U, -e, and -E, as well
as the environment variables used by those options.
.TP 4
.B \-e <URI>
Specifies that <URI> should be used as the origin URI for the extra repository.
See \fBONEXTRAURI\fP below for default values.
.TP 4
.B \-E <publisher>
Specifies that <publisher> should be used as the publisher name for
the extra repository.  See \fBONEXTRAPUB\fP below for default values.
.TP 4
.B \-O
Open mode, where the extra repository will not be used.
.TP 4
.B \-s <beName>
Specifies that <beName> should be used as the source Boot Environment to
clone.  The default is the active BE.
.TP 4
.B \-t <beName>
Specifies the target BE name.  Note that this argument is required; there
is no default value.
.TP 4
.B \-u <URI>
Specifies that <beName> should be used as the origin URI for the publisher
packaging repository.  See \fBONURI\fP below for default values.
.TP 4
.B \-U <publisher>
Specifies that <publisher> should be used as the publisher name for
the packaging repository.  See \fBONPUB\fP below for default values.
.TP 4
.B \-v
Verbose mode.
.TP 4
.B \-Z
Do not update any installed zones.
.SH EXIT STATUS
.LP
The following exit values are returned:
.TP 4
.B 0
The command completed successfully.
No errors or warnings were reported.
.LP
.TP 4
.B 1
Incorrect usage.
.LP
.TP 4
.B 2
One of the commands used by the script failed.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.LP
ONURI
.IP
If the -u option is not provided, and this variable is set, it will be used
as the origin URI for the publisher packaging repository.  If -u is not
provided and this variable is not set, http://ipkg.sfbay/on-nightly will
be used.
.LP
ONPUB
.IP
If the -U option is not provided, and this variable is set, it will be
used as the publisher name for the packaging repository.  If -U is not
provided and this variable is not set, on-nightly will be used.
.LP
ONEXTRAURI
.IP
If the -e option is not provided, and this variable is set, it will be used
as the origin URI for the extra repository.  If -e is not provided and this
variable is not set, http://ipkg.sfbay/on-extra will be used.  Note: for
external users where an extra repository does not apply, use the -O option.
.LP
ONEXTRAPUB
.IP
If the -E option is not provided, and this variable is set, it will be
used as the publisher name for the extra repository.  If -E is not
provided and this variable is not set, on-extra will be used.
.LP
.SH NOTES
.LP
Use of
.I onu
will prevent use of zone attach for ipkg-brand zones in the new BE,
since the
.B entire
incorporation is removed.
.LP
By default,
.I onu
will attempt to update any ipkg-brand installed zones on the system; the
.B -Z
option may be used to disable this behavior.
.LP
If the
.B -d
option is given to specify a repository directory, subsequent zone
installs in the new BE will not work. In this case, a suitable
repository matching the one used must be set up in the global zone
before a zone install is attempted, otherwise the package contents of
the zone may differ incompatibly from the global zone version.
