.SH NAME
.I check_rtime
\- check ELF runtime attributes
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBcheck_rtime [-a] [-d depdir] [-i] [-m] [-o] [-s] file | dir, ...\fP
.LP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX "OS-Net build tools" "check_rtime" "" "\fBcheck_rtime\fP"
.LP
.I check_rtime
attempts to check a number of ELF runtime attributes
for consistency with common build rules.
These checks involve running \fBldd(1)\fP and
\fBelfdump(1)\fP against a family of dynamic objects.
A dynamic object can be defined explicitly as a \fIfile\fP
or multiple dynamic objects can be located under the directory \fIdir\fP.
.LP
.I check_rtime
is typically called from \fBnightly(1)\fP when the \fB-r\fP
option is in effect. In this case the dynamic objects under
the associated \fIproto\fP area (\fB$ROOT\fP) are checked.
.I check_rtime
can also be run standalone against any set of dynamic objects.
.LP
.I check_rtime
uses \fBldd(1)\fP to verify dependencies. This implies that
by default any object inspected will bind to its dependencies
as they are found in the \fBunderlying\fP system.  Use of the \fB-d\fP
option, or the existence of the environment variables
\fB$CODEMGR_WS/$ROOT\fP instruct
.I check_rtime
to establish an alternative dependency mapping using
runtime configuration files generated with \fBcrle(1)\fP.
.LP
.I check_rtime
uses \fBldd(1)\fP to completely relocate any dynamic
object and thus detect missing dependencies, unsatisfied
symbol relocations, unused and unreferenced dependencies. These checks
are carried out for the following reasons:
.TP 4
\(bu
An object that cannot find its dependencies may fail to load
at runtime.  This error condition often goes unnoticed
because the existing use of the object is as a dependency itself,
and the objects' dependencies are already satisfied by the
caller.  However, if the object itself is unable to satisfy its
dependencies its use in new environments may be compromised.
.sp
A missing or erroneous \fBrunpath\fP is the typical reason why
an object can not locate its dependencies.  Use of the link-editors
\fB-zdefs\fP option when building a shared object ensures required
dependencies are established.  This flag is inherited from
\fB$(DYNFLAGS)\fP in \fIlib/Makefile.lib\fP. Missing dependencies
are displayed as:
.sp
.RS 6
foo: bar.so.1 => (file not found)  <no -zdefs?>
.RE
.TP
\(bu
Unsatisfied symbol relocations indicate that some thread of
execution through the object will fail when it is unable to
locate a referenced symbol.
.sp
A missing, or mismatched version of a dependency is the typical
reason for unsatisfied symbol relocations (see missing dependency
discussion above). Unsatisfied symbol relocations are displayed as:
.sp
.RS 6
foo: symbol not found: bar  <no -zdefs?>
.RE
.TP
\(bu
Unused dependencies are wasteful at runtime, as they take time to
load and relocate, but will not be used by the calling object.  They
also result in unnecessary processing at link-edit time.
.sp
Dependency lists (typically defined via \fB$(LDLIBS)\fP)
that have been yanked-and-put
between \fIMakefiles\fP without verifying their need, is a typical
reason why unused dependencies exist.  Unused dependencies are
displayed as:
.sp
.RS 6
foo: unused object=bar.so.1  <remove lib or -zignore?>
.RE
.TP
\(bu
Unreferenced dependencies are also wasteful at runtime, although not
to the extent of unused dependencies.  They also result in unnecessary
processing at link-edit time.
.sp
Unreferenced dependency removal guards against a dependency becoming
unused when combined with
different objects, or as the other object dependencies evolve.
Unreferenced dependencies are displayed as:
.sp
.RS 6
foo: unreferenced object=bar.so.1; unused dependency of libfoo.so.1
.RE
.sp
See also the section ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES.
.LP
.I check_rtime
uses \fBelfdump(1)\fP to look for a concatenated relocation
section in shared objects, the existence of text relocations,
whether debugging or symbol table information exists, whether
applications have a non-executable stack defined, duplicate
entries in the symbol sorting sections, and for direct bindings.
These checks are carried out for the following reasons:
.TP 4
\(bu
A concatenated relocation section (\fI.SUNW_reloc\fP)
provides optimal symbol table
access as runtime, and thus reduces the overhead of relocating
the shared object.  In past releases, the link-edit of a dynamic object with
the \fB-z combreloc\fP option was required to generate a combined
relocation section.  However, with the integration of 6642769, this section
combination is a default behavior of the link-editor.
.sp
In past releases, not inheriting \fB$(DYNFLAGS)\fP from
\fIlib/Makefile.lib\fP was the typical reason for not having a
concatenated relocation section. The misguided use of the
\fB-z nocombreloc\fP option will also prevent the creation of a
concatenated relocation section. A missing concatenated relocation section
is displayed as:
.sp
.RS 6
foo: SUNW_reloc section missing  <no -zcombreloc?>
.RE
.TP
\(bu
Text relocations result in impure text segments.  As text segments
are typically read-only, they can be shared between numerous processes.
If they must be updated as part of the relocation then the updated
pages become unshareable and swap space must be allocated to back
these pages.  These events consume unnecessary system resources and
reduce overall system performance.
.sp
Not inheriting the \fB$(PICS)\fP
rules from \fIlib/Makefile.lib\fP is the typical reason for having
non-pic code in shared objects.  Text relocations are displayed as:
.sp
.RS 6
foo: TEXTREL .dynamic tag  <no -Kpic?>
.RE
.TP
\(bu
Debugging information is unnecessary in released objects.  Although
extensive when compiled \fB-g\fP, small quantities of debugging
information are stored in \fI.stabs\fP sections under normal
compilations.  This debugging information is geared towards aiding
debuggers locate relocatable objects associated with the dynamic
objects being debugged.  As relocatable objects aren't made available
as part of a software release this information has no use.
.sp
Not inheriting the correct \fB$(LDFLAGS)\fP from \fIcmd/Makefile.cmd\fP
(which asserts \fP-s\fP), or \fB$(POST_PROCESS_SO)\fP (which asserts
\fIstrip -x\fP) are typical reasons for not removing debugging
information.  Note, removal of debugging information is only enabled
for release builds. The existence of debugging information is displayed as:
.sp
.RS 6
foo: debugging sections should be deleted  <no strip -x?>
.RE
.TP
\(bu
All objects should retain their full \fI.symtab\fP symbol table.
Although this consumes disk space, it provides for more extensive stack
tracing when debugging user applications.
.sp
Hard coding a \fI-s\fP flag with \fB$(LDFLAGS)\fP or
\fB$(DYNFLAGS)\fP is the typical
reason for symbol tables being removed.
Objects that do not contain a symbol table are displayed as:
.sp
.RS 6
foo.so.1: symbol table should not be stripped  <remove -s?>
.RE
.TP
\(bu
Applications should have a non-executable stack defined to make
them less vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks.
.sp
Not inheriting the \fB$(LDFLAGS)\fP macro in \fIcmd/Makefile.cmd\fP
is the typical reason for not having a non-executable stack definition.
Applications without this definition are displayed as:
.sp
.RS 6
foo: application requires non-executable stack \\
.br
	<no -Mmapfile_noexstk?>
.RE
.sp
.TP
\(bu
X86 applications should have a non-executable data segment defined to make
them less vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks.
.sp
Not inheriting the \fB$(LDFLAGS)\fP macro in \fIcmd/Makefile.cmd\fP
is the typical reason for not having a non-executable data definition.
Applications without this definition are displayed as:
.sp
.RS 6
foo: application requires non-executable data \\
.br
	<no -Mmapfile_noexdata?>
.RE
.sp
.TP
\(bu
Solaris ELF files contain symbol sort sections used by DTrace to
map addresses in memory to the related function or variable symbols. There
are two such sections, \fI.SUNW_dynsymsort\fP for
regular symbols, and \fI.SUNW_dyntlssort\fP for thread
local symbols. To ensure that the best
names are shown for each
such address, and that the same name is given across Solaris releases,
.I check_rtime
enforces the rule that only one symbol can appear in the sort sections for
any given address.
There are two common ways in which multiple symbols 
or a given address occur in the ON distribution. The first is from
code written in assembly language. The second is as a 
result of using \fB#pragma weak\fP in C to create weak symbols. The
best solution to this
situation is to modify the code to avoid symbol aliasing. Alternatively,
the \fBNODYNSORT\fP mapfile attribute can be used to eliminate the unwanted
symbol.
.sp
Duplicate entries in a symbol sort section are
displayed in one of the following ways, depending on
whether the section is for regular, or thread local symbols:
.sp
.RS 6
foo: .SUNW_dynsymsort: duplicate ADDRESS: sym1, sym2
.br
foo: .SUNW_dyntlssort: duplicate OFFSET: sym1, sym2
.RE
.sp
.TP
\(bu
\fBOSNet\fP dynamic ELF objects are expected to employ direct bindings whenever
feasible.  This runtime binding technique helps to avoid accidental
interposition problems, and provides a more optimal
runtime symbol search model.
.sp
Not inheriting the correct \fB$(LDFLAGS)\fP from \fIcmd/Makefile.cmd\fP,
or the correct \fB$(DYNFLAGS)\fP from \fIlib/Makefile.lib\fP, are the
typical reasons for not enabling direct bindings. Dynamic objects that
do not contain direct binding information are displayed as:
.sp
.RS 6
foo: object has no direct bindings \\
.br
	<no -B direct or -z direct?>
.RE

.sp
.LP
.I check_rtime also
uses \fBelfdump(1)\fP
to display useful dynamic entry information under the \fB-i\fP option.
This doesn't necessarily indicate an error condition, but
provides information that is often useful for gatekeepers to track
changes in a release.  Presently the information listed is:
.TP
\(bu
Runpaths are printed for any dynamic object.  This is a historic
sanity check to insure compiler supplied runpaths (typically from \fBCC\fP)
are not recorded in any objects.  Runpaths are displayed as:
.sp
.RS 6
foo: RPATH=/usr/bar/lib
.RE
.TP
\(bu
Needed dependencies are printed for any dynamic object.
In the freeware world this often helps the introducer of a new
shared object discover that an existing binary has become its
consumer, and thus that binaries package dependencies may require updating.
Dependencies are printed as:
.sp
.RS 6
foo: NEEDED=bar.so.1
.RE
.sp
.LP
.I check_rtime
uses \fBmcs(1)\fP to inspect an objects \fI.comment\fP section.
During development, this section contains numerous file identifiers
marked with the tag "\fB@(#)\fP".  For release builds these sections
are deleted and rewritten under control of the \fB$(POST_PROCESS)\fP
macro to produce a common release identifier.  This identifier
typically consists of three lines including a single comment starting
with the string "\fB@(#) SunOS\fP".  If this common identifier isn't
found the following diagnostic is generated:
.sp
.RS 6
foo: non-conforming mcs(1) comment  <no $(POST_PROCESS)?>
.RE
.sp
.LP
.SH OPTIONS
.LP
The following options are supported:
.TP 4
.B \-a
Process all dynamic objects found.
As with all attempts to follow standard build rules, there are
always exceptions. As
.I check_rtime
was primarily designed to process a nightly builds \fB$ROOT\fP
hierarchy, and there exist numerous \fBOSNet\fP components
that fail its tests,
.I check_rtime
maintains a list of directories and files (as they exist in a
\fB$ROOT\fP directory hierarchy) that will be skipped
during its processing.  Use of \fB-a\fP prevents this component
skipping.
.sp
In addition there are a couple of optimizations within
.I check_rtime
directory traversal that improve the scripts performance.
Use of \fB-a\fP ignores these optimizations.
.TP
.B \-d depdir
Use \fIdepdir\fP to generate an alternative dependency mapping.
.TP
.B \-i
Provide dynamic entry information.  Presently only dependencies and
runpaths are printed.
.sp
\fBNote\fP, any references to \fIlibintl.so.1\fP or \fIlibw.so.1\fP
are flagged as being unnecessary as all the interfaces provided by
these shared objects were folded into \fIlibc\fP in Solaris 5.6.
.TP
.B \-m
Enable \fBmcs(1)\fP checking.
.TP
.B \-o
Produce a one-line output for each condition discovered, prefixed
by the objects name.  This output style is more terse, but is
more appropriate for sorting and diffing with previous build results.
.TP
.B \-s
Determine whether \fI.stabs\fP sections exist.
.LP
.SH ALTERNATIVE DEPENDENCY MAPPING
As
.I check_rtime
was primarily designed to process a nightly builds \fB$ROOT\fP
hierarchy, it is often the case that objects within this hierarchy
must bind to dependencies within the same hierarchy to satisfy
their requirements.
.LP
To achieve this,
.I check_rtime
uses the directory specified with the \fB-d\fP option, or the
existence of the environment variables \fB$CODEMGR_WS\fP and \fB$ROOT\fP
to generate a list of available shared objects.  This list is used
to create runtime configuration files via \fBcrle(1)\fP, that establish
the new shared objects as alternatives to their underlying system location.
.I check_rtime
passes these configuration files as \fBLD_CONFIG\fP environment
variable settings to \fBldd(1)\fP using its \fB-e\fP option.
.LP
The effect of these configuration files is that the execution of an
object under \fBldd(1)\fP will bind to the dependencies defined as
alternatives.  Simply put, an object inspected in the \fIproto\fP
area will bind to its dependencies found in the \fIproto\fP area.
Dependencies that have no alternative mapping will continue to
bind to the underlying system.
.LP
.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.LP
When the \fB-d\fP option isn't in use
.I check_rtime
uses the following environment variables to
establish an alternative dependency mapping:
.LP
.B CODEMGR_WS
.RS 4
The root of your Teamware workspace, which is the directory
containing \fICodemgr_wsdata\fP. Existence of this environment variable
indicates that \fB$ROOT\fP should be investigated.
.RE
.LP
.B ROOT
.RS 4
Root of the \fIproto\fP area of your Teamware workspace. Any shared objects
under this directory will be used to establish an alternative dependency
mapping.
.RE
.sp
If \fBldd(1)\fP supports the \fB-U\fP option it will be used to determine
any unreferenced dependencies.  Otherwise \fBldd(1)\fP uses the older
\fB-u\fP option which only detects unused references.  If the following
environment variable exists, and indicates an earlier release than \fB5.10\fP
then \fBldd(1)\fP also falls back to using the \fB-u\fP option.
.RE
.LP
.B RELEASE
.RS 4
The release version number of the environment being built.
.RE
.SH ERROR CONDITIONS
.LP
Use of an alternative dependency mapping requires \fBldd(1) -e\fP. This
option is relatively new (see 4390308 integrated in s81_30), thus
.I check_rtime
validates \fBldd(1)\fP before attempting to create an alternative
dependency mapping.  An older version of \fBldd(1)\fP will be caught as:
.sp
.RS 4
ldd: does not support -e, ....
.RE
.LP
Inspection of an object with \fBldd(1)\fP assumes it is compatible
with the machine on which
.I check_rtime
is being run.  Incompatible objects such as a 64-bit object encountered on
a 32-bit system, or an i386 object encountered on a sparc system,
can not be fully inspected.  These objects are displayed as:
.sp
.RS 4
foo: has wrong class or data encoding
