		     OS/Net (ON) binaries for Buildable Source

This delivery of the binaries to enable the Buildable Source consists of 2
pieces: 

1. encumbered binaries tarball (on-closed-bins-DATE.PLATFORM.tar.bz2)
2. signed cryptographic binaries (on-crypto-DATE.PLATFORM.tar.bz2)

BFU archives are no longer supported.

If you want to build the entire source tree, you will need the source,
the encumbered binaries, and the cryptographic binaries. The tools may
be bootstrapped from your source tree.

The encumbered binaries tarball contains complete binaries (libraries,
kernel modules, commands) that are compatible with the source.  These
are binaries that cannot be built using only the source tarball for
one reason or another.

The cryptographic binaries have been signed with a certificate and key
that enables their use.  The cryptographic binaries that you build
from source will not be usable unless you have obtained your own
certificate and key.  See elfsign(1) for more information related to
signing binaries.

To obtain source, ensure that you have Mercurial installed (if you do
not, utter 'pkg install developer/versioning/mercurial'), and then
checkout from the Mercurial repository; please see instructions at:
http://hub.opensolaris.org/bin/view/Project+onnv/


Build Environment
-----------------

To build from source, you will also need the proper compiler, and you
must be running a recent build. The build schedule is available at
http://hub.opensolaris.org/bin/view/Community+Group+on/schedule. 

The standard compiler for building OpenSolaris code is Sun Studio,
which is free to download and use.  You can also use gcc.  See the
section "Installing from Source" (below) for details.

Build machines are expected to be running an OpenSolaris build that
is no more than 2 builds behind the source that you're building.  For
example, if you're building snv_143, your build machine should be
running snv_141 or later.


Other Important Information
---------------------------

The buildable source contains the source for our high key-strength
crypto, known as the Encryption Kit (SUNWcry, SUNWcryr, SUNWcryptoint).
Please note that certain countries restrict the redistribution of
high key-strength crypto.  If you live in one of these countries,
it is your responsibility to ensure that you are complying with your
country's laws in this area.

For general questions on the buildable source, please ask on the
OpenSolaris Help discussion list (opensolaris-help <at> opensolaris
<dot> org).  For detailed comments about the code, please use the
on-discuss list.  Please note that the mailing lists are configured to
only allow posts from list subscribers.  The Help list also has a web
forum that is gatewayed with the mailing list.  More information about
OpenSolaris lists is available at
http://hub.opensolaris.org/bin/view/Main/discussions.
