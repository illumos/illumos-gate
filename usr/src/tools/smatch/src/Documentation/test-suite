	Sparse test suite
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sparse has a number of test cases in its validation directory. The test-suite
script aims at making automated checking of these tests possible. It works by
embedding tags in C comments in the test cases.

check-name: (mandatory)
	Name of the test.

check-description: (optional)
	A description of what the test checks.

check-command: (optional)
	There are different kinds of tests. Some can validate the sparse
	preprocessor, while others will use sparse, cgcc, or even other backends
	of the library. check-command allows you to give a custom command to
	run the test-case.
	The '$file' string is special. It will be expanded to the file name at
	run time.
	It defaults to "sparse $file".

check-exit-value: (optional)
	The expected exit value of check-command. It defaults to 0.

check-timeout: (optional)
	The maximum expected duration of check-command, in seconds.
	It defaults to 1.

check-output-start / check-output-end (optional)
	The expected output (stdout and stderr) of check-command lies between
	those two tags. It defaults to no output.

check-output-ignore / check-error-ignore (optional)
	Don't check the expected output (stdout or stderr) of check-command
	(useful when this output is not comparable or if you're only interested
	in the exit value).
	By default this check is done.

check-known-to-fail (optional)
	Mark the test as being known to fail.

check-output-contains: <pattern> (optional)
	Check that the output (stdout) contains the given pattern.
	Several such tags can be given, in which case the output
	must contains all the patterns.

check-output-excludes: <pattern> (optional)
	Similar than the above one, but with opposite logic.
	Check that the output (stdout) doesn't contain the given pattern.
	Several such tags can be given, in which case the output
	must contains none of the patterns.

check-output-pattern-<nbr>-times: <pattern> (optional)
	Similar to the contains/excludes above, but with full control
	of the number of times the pattern should occur in the output.

	Using test-suite
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The test-suite script is called through the check target of the Makefile. It
will try to check every test case it finds (find validation -name '*.c').

It can be called to check a single test with:
$ cd validation
$ ./test-suite single preprocessor/preprocessor1.c
     TEST     Preprocessor #1 (preprocessor/preprocessor1.c)
preprocessor/preprocessor1.c passed !


	Writing a test
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

test-suite comes with a format command to make a test easier to write:

	test-suite format file [name [cmd]]

name:
	check-name value. If no name is provided, it defaults to the file name.
cmd:
	check-command value. If no cmd is provided, it defaults to
	"sparse $file".

The output of the test-suite format command can be redirected into the
test case to create a test-suite formatted file.

$ ./test-suite format bad-assignment.c Assignment >> bad-assignment.c
$ cat !$
cat bad-assignment.c
/*
 * check-name: bad assignment
 *
 * check-command: sparse $file
 * check-exit-value: 1
 *
 * check-output-start
bad-assignment.c:3:6: error: Expected ; at end of statement
bad-assignment.c:3:6: error: got \
 * check-output-end
 */

You can define the check-command you want to use for the test. $file will be
extended to the file name at run time.

$ ./test-suite format validation/preprocessor2.c "Preprocessor #2" \
		"sparse -E \$file" >> validation/preprocessor2.c
$ cat !$
cat validation/preprocessor2.c
/*
 * This one we happen to get right.
 *
 * It should result in a simple
 *
 *	a + b
 *
 * for a proper preprocessor.
 */
#define TWO a, b

#define UNARY(x) BINARY(x)
#define BINARY(x, y) x + y

UNARY(TWO)
/*
 * check-name: Preprocessor #2
 *
 * check-command: sparse -E $file
 * check-exit-value: 0
 *
 * check-output-start

a + b
 * check-output-end
 */
