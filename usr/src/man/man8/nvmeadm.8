The
.Nm
utility can be used to enumerate the NVMe controllers and their
namespaces, query hardware information from a NVMe controller or
namespace, and to format or secure-erase a NVMe controller or
namespace.
.Pp
The information returned by the hardware is printed by
.Nm
in a human-readable form were applicable.
Generally all 0-based counts are normalized and values may be
converted to human-readable units such as MB (megabytes), W (watts),
or C (degrees Celsius).
.Sh OPTIONS
The following options are supported:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl h
Print a short help text for
.Nm ,
or for an optionally specified
.Nm
command.
.It Fl d

.El
.Sh ARGUMENTS
.Nm
expects the following kinds of arguments:
.Bl -tag -width "ctl[/ns]"
.It Ar command
Any command
.Nm
understands.
See section
.Sx COMMANDS .
.It Ar ctl[/ns]
Specifies a NVMe controller and optionally a namespace within that
controller.
The controller name consists of the driver name
.Qq nvme
followed by an instance number.
A namespace is specified by appending a single
.Qq /
to the controller name, followed by either the namespace ID or the namespace
EUI64 or NGUID as reported by the
.Cm identify
command.
The namespace ID is a positive non-zero decimal number.
For commands that don't change the device state multiple controllers
and namespaces can be specified as a comma-separated list.
.Pp
The list of controllers and namespaces present in the system can be
queried with the
.Cm list
command without any arguments.
.It Ar logpage
Specifies the log page name for the
.Cm get-logpage
command.
.It Ar feature-list
A comma-separated list of feature names for the
.Cm get-features
command.
Feature names can be specified in upper or lower case.
All features can be specified either by a short name listed below or by
the full name that the specification uses.
.It Ar lba-format
A non-zero integer specifying the LBA format for the
.Cm format
command.
The list of supported LBA formats on a namespace can be retrieved
with the
.Nm
.Cm identify
command.

.It Sy SOURCES
This is a comma separated list of values that indicates where
information about this log page and its support came from primarily.
These include the following:
.Bl -tag -width identify-controller
.It Dq spec
This comes from the NVMe specification.
Generally this refers to mandatory log pages that are not dependent on
any information in the identify controller data structure.
.It Dq identify-controller
Information about this log page comes from the identify controller data
structure.
Many log pages are described by the standard but are optional and their
support is indicated through that.
.It Dq internal-db
This indicates that information about this log page comes from our
internal databases in libnvme.
Most vendor-specific logs are described in datasheets whose information
is encoded into the library and system and there is not always a way to
discover that it is supported or not.
.It Dq command
This indicates that information about this log page came from another
command that was issued to the controller which indicates what was
implemented and present.
.El
.It Sy KIND
This indicates the kind of log page that this is.
Valid options are:
.Bl -tag -width vendor-specific
.It Dq mandatory
Indicates that the NVMe specification considers this mandatory for all
controllers of a given version.
.It Dq optional
Indicates that the NVMe specification considers this log page optional.
Some items may be mandatory if a device implements an optional feature
like namespace management, but they will still be considered optional as
the underlying feature is.
.It Dq vendor-specific
Indicates that this log is a vendor-specific log page.
These log pages are not part of the NVMe standard and are generally
described in their own device's datasheets or a separate standard such
as the
.%T OCP Datacenter NVMe SSD Specification .
.El
.El
.Pp
The
.Cm list-logpages
command supports a series of operands which can be used to filter the
list of log pages that information is printed out about.
Each
.Ar logpage
operand is the name of a log page.
Only matching log pages will be printed and if no log pages match a
given operand argument or not log pages are printed at all
.Pq which can happen due to a log being unsupported
then the command will generate an error.
.It Xo
.Nm
.Cm get-logpage
.Op Fl O Ar output-file
.Ar ctl[/ns] Ns [,...]
.Ar logpage
.Xc
Print the specified log page of the specified controllers and/or namespaces.

.Fl O
is specified, rather than print the contents of the log, the raw binary payload
of the log will be written to
.Ar output-file .
Most log pages are only available on a per-controller basis.
Known log pages are:
.Bl -tag -width "firmware"
.It suplog

of the specified namespace(s).
.Pp
Note that not all devices support erasing individual or all
namespaces, or support erasing at all.
.It Xo
.Nm
.Cm detach
.Ar ctl[/ns]
.Xc
Temporarily detaches the
.Xr blkdev 4D
instance from the specified namespace or all namespaces of the controller.
This will prevent I/O access to the affected namespace(s).
Detach will only succeed if the affected namespace(s) are not
currently opened.
The detached state will not persist across reboots or reloads of the
.Xr nvme 4D
driver.
.Pp
It is not an error to detach a namespace that is already detached, any such
request will be silently ignored.
.It Xo
.Nm
.Cm attach
.Ar ctl[/ns]
.Xc
Attaches the
.Xr blkdev 4D
instance to the specified namespace or all namespaces of the controller.
This will make I/O accesses to the namespace(s) possible again after a
previous
.Nm
.Cm detach
command.
.Pp
It is not an error to attach a namespace that is already attached, any such
request will be silently ignored.
.It Xo
.Nm
.Cm list-firmware
.Ar ctl
.Xc
List currently active firmware slot, the next active firmware slot, and the
current contents of all firmware slots of an NVMe controller.
This is a synonym for the
.Nm
.Cm get-logpage
.Ar ctl
.Cm firmware
command.
.It Xo
.Nm
.Cm load-firmware
.Ar ctl
.Ar firmware-file
.Op Ar offset
.Xc
Loads
.Ar firmware-file
into the controller's upload memory at
.Ar offset ,
the default is 0. A vendor may require multiple files to be loaded
at different offsets before the firmware is committed to a
.Ar slot .
.It Xo
.Nm
.Cm commit-firmware
.Ar ctl
.Ar slot
.Xc
Commits firmware previously loaded by the
.Cm load-firmware
command to
.Ar slot .
.It Xo
.Nm
.Cm activate-firmware
.Ar ctl
.Ar slot
.Xc
Activates the firmware in slot
.Ar slot .
The firmware image in
.Ar slot
is activated at the next NVM controller reset.
.It Xo
.Nm
.Cm wdc/e6dump
.Fl o Ar output
.Ar ctl
.Xc
This vendor-specific command performs a diagnostic dump of device data
to the file specified by
.Ar output .
The device remains in full service while this is occurring.
.It Xo
.Nm
.Cm wdc/resize
.Fl s Ar size | Fl g
.Ar ctl
.Xc
This vendor-specific command will get the current over provisioning size
or set it.
This command operates using power of 10 bytes, that is in terms of
gigabytes and not gibibytes.
The sizes that are used here will be different from those that the
operating system will report for the drive.
.Pp
The following options are supported:
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It Fl g
Returns the current size of the device in gigabytes
.Pq powers of 10 .
.It Fl s Ar size
Sets the size of the device to
.Ar size
which is in gigabytes
.Pq powers of 10 .
This can be used to adjust the over provisioning ratio on the device.
The valid points are device-specific.
Please consult WDC datasheets for more information.
.Pp
When performing a resize
.Em all data and namespace will be erased !
All namespaces must be detached prior to issuing this.
.El
.It Xo
.Nm
.Op Fl dv
.Cm wdc/clear-assert
.Ar ctl
.Xc
This clears an internal assertion record from a WDC device.
Prior to running this any such internal assertion should be saved by using the
.Cm wdc/e6dump
command.
This command should only be used if instructed to do so as part of a
troubleshooting process.
.It Xo
.Nm
.Op Fl dv
.Cm wdc/inject-assert
.Ar ctl
.Xc
This injects a device assertion into a WDC NVMe device.
The behavior of doing so is device specific; however, all I/O will be
interrupted and the device may be retired.
Unless explicitly instructed as part of debugging a device or as part of
internal development, this command should not be used.
