.TH DISKSCAN 8 "Feb 24, 1998"
.SH NAME
diskscan \- perform surface analysis
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBdiskscan\fR [\fB-W\fR] [\fB-n\fR] [\fB-y\fR] \fIraw_device\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBdiskscan\fR is used by the system administrator to perform surface analysis
on a portion of a hard disk. The disk portion may be a raw partition or slice;
it is identified using its raw device name. By default, the specified portion
of the disk is read (non-destructive) and errors reported on standard error. In
addition, a progress report is printed on standard out. The list of bad blocks
should be saved in a file and later fed into \fBaddbadsec\fR(8), which will
remap them.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-n\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
Causes  \fBdiskscan\fR to suppress linefeeds when printing progress information
on standard out.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-W\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
Causes \fBdiskscan\fR to perform write and read surface analysis. This type of
surface analysis is destructive and should be invoked with caution.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-y\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
Causes  \fBdiskscan\fR to suppress the warning regarding destruction of
existing data that is issued when  \fB-W\fR is used.
.RE

.SH OPERANDS
.sp
.LP
The following operands are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fIraw_device\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 14n
The address of the disk drive (see \fBFILES\fR).
.RE

.SH FILES

The raw device should be \fB/dev/rdsk/c?[t?]d?[ps]?\fR. See \fBdisks\fR(8) for
an explanation of \fBSCSI\fR and \fBIDE\fR device naming conventions.

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
The \fBformat\fR(8) utility is available to format, label, analyze, and repair
\fBSCSI\fR disks. This utility is included with the \fBdiskscan\fR,
\fBaddbadsec\fR(8), \fBfdisk\fR(8), and \fBfmthard\fR(8) commands available
for x86. To format an \fBIDE\fR disk, use the \fB DOS\fR \fBformat\fR utility;
however, to label, analyze, or repair \fBIDE\fR disks on x86 systems, use the
Solaris \fBformat\fR(8) utility.
