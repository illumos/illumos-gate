.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBpkginfo\fR displays information about software packages that are installed
on the system (with the first synopsis)  or that reside on a particular device
or directory (with the second synopsis).
.sp
.LP
Without options, \fBpkginfo\fR lists the primary category, package instance,
and the names of all completely installed and partially installed packages. It
displays one line for each package selected.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The \fB-p\fR and \fB-i\fR options are meaningless if used in conjunction with
the \fB-d\fR option.
.sp
.LP
The options \fB-q\fR, \fB-x\fR, and \fB-l\fR are mutually exclusive.

.sp
.ne 2

\fB\fB-c\fR \fIcategory\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Display packages that match  \fIcategory\fR. Categories are defined with the
\fBCATEGORY\fR parameter in the \fBpkginfo\fR(4) file. If more than one
category is supplied, the  package needs to match only one category in the
list. The match is not case specific.
.RE

.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-d\fR \fIdevice\fR\fR

.sp .6
.RS 4n
Defines a device, \fIdevice\fR, on which the software resides. \fIdevice\fR can
be an absolute directory pathname or the identifiers for tape, floppy disk,
removable disk, and so forth. The special token  \fBspool\fR may be used to
indicate the default installation spool directory (\fB/var/spool/pkg\fR).

files, including package system information files, are relocated to a directory
tree starting in the specified \fIroot_path\fR.

\fB\fB-v\fR \fIversion\fR\fR

.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specify the version of the package as \fIversion\fR. The version is defined
with the \fBVERSION\fR parameter in the \fBpkginfo\fR(4) file. All compatible
versions can be requested by preceding the version name with a tilde
(\fB\(ap\fR). Multiple white spaces are replaced with a single white space
during version comparison.

.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
A package designation by its instance. An instance can be the package
abbreviation or a specific instance (for example, \fBinst.1\fR or
\fBinst.2\fR). All instances of a package can be requested by \fBinst.*\fR. The
asterisk character (\fB*\fR) is a special character to some shells and may need
to be escaped. In the C-Shell, "\fB*\fR" must be surrounded by single quotes
(\fB\&'\fR) or preceded by a backslash (\e).

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
Package commands are \fBlargefile\fR(5)-aware. They handle files larger than 2
GB in the same way they handle smaller files. In their current implementations,
\fBpkgadd\fR(1M), \fBpkgtrans\fR(1) and other package commands can process a
datastream of  up to 4 GB.
