.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fBcrle\fR utility provides for the creation and display of a runtime
linking configuration file. The configuration file is read and interpreted by
the runtime linker, \fBld.so.1\fR(1), during process startup. The runtime
linker attempts to read a default configuration file for all processes. For
32-bit processes, the default configuration file is \fB/var/ld/ld.config\fR.
For 64-bit processes, the default configuration file is
\fB/var/ld/64/ld.config\fR.
.sp
.LP
Without any arguments, or with just the \fB-c\fR option, \fBcrle\fR displays
configuration information. This information includes the contents of a
configuration file, any system defaults and the command-line required to
regenerate the configuration file. When used with any other options, a new
configuration file is created or updated.
.sp
.LP
The runtime linker can also be directed to an alternative configuration file by
setting one of the \fBLD_CONFIG\fR family of environment variable.
\fBLD_CONFIG\fR applies to both 32-bit and 64-bit programs. Since 32-bit and
64-bit configuration files differ, a single configuration file cannot be used
for both class of object. Hence, \fBLD_CONFIG\fR can adversely affect program
execution in cases where a program of one class executes a program of the other
class. In particular, it is common practice for the 32-bit version of standard
Solaris utilities to execute their 64-bit counterpart. \fBLD_CONFIG\fR cannot
be successfully used in this case. Therefore, the use of the \fBLD_CONFIG_32\fR
and \fBLD_CONFIG_64\fR environment variables, that precisely target the
appropriate class of process, is recommended.
.sp
.LP
Creating an incorrect configuration file in the standard location,
\fB/var/ld\fR, can prevent programs from running, and can therefore be
difficult to recover from. To guard against this situation, it is recommended
that new configuration files first be created in a temporary location. Then set
the appropriate \fBLD_CONFIG\fR environment variable to this new configuration
file. This setting causes the new configuration file to be used by the runtime
linker instead of any default. After verification, the new configuration file
can be moved to the default location if desired. At any time, the environment
variable \fBLD_NOCONFIG\fR can be set to any value to instruct the runtime
linker to ignore any configuration files. This setting can prove useful during
experimentation.
.sp
.LP
A configuration file can contain the following information.
.sp

.na
\fBDefault Search Paths\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
The runtime linker uses a prescribed search path for locating the dynamic
dependencies of an object. This search path starts with the components of any
\fBLD_LIBRARY_PATH\fR definition, followed by the components of an object's
\fBrunpath\fR. Finally, any default search paths specific to the object's class
are used. This last component of the search path can be expressed within the
configuration file. Typically, use of this facility should be augmented with
any system default. See the \fB-l\fR and \fB-u\fR options.

\fBTrusted Directories\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
When processing a secure application, the runtime linker restricts the use of
\fBLD_LIBRARY_PATH\fR searches, and \fB$ORIGIN\fR token expansion. See
\fISecurity\fR in \fILinker and Libraries Guide\fR. In addition, the
directories from which preload and audit libraries can be located are also
restricted. The path names that are associated with preload and audit libraries
are restricted to known trusted directories. Trusted directories can be
expressed within the configuration file. Typically, use of this facility should
be augmented with any system defaults. See the \fB-s\fR and \fB-u\fR options.

.RE

\fBDirectory Cache\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
The location of shared objects within defined directories can be maintained as
a cache within the configuration file. This directory cache can reduce the
overhead of searching for application dependencies.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fBAlternative Objects\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
In conjunction with the directory cache, shared objects can have alternative
objects specified for use at runtime. These alternate objects, can be supplied
by the user. Alternative objects can also be created by \fBcrle\fR as copies of
shared objects fixed to known memory locations. These fixed alternative objects
can require less processing at runtime than their original shared object
counterpart.
.RE

.sp
.LP
Defining additional default search paths, or additional trusted directories can
be useful for administrators who wish to install third party software in a
central location, or otherwise alter the search path of applications that might
not have been coded with a suitable runpath.
.sp
.LP
The declaration of alternative objects provides a means of replacing
dependencies other than by using symbolic links or requiring
\fBLD_LIBRARY_PATH\fR settings.
.sp
.LP
The declaration of environment variables that are interpreted by the runtime
linker provides a means of centralizing their definition for all applications.
.sp
.LP
The directory cache, and \fBcrle\fR generated alternate objects, can provide a
means of reducing the runtime startup overhead of applications. Alternative
objects can be useful for applications that require many dependencies, or whose
dependencies are expensive to relocate. Shared objects that contain
\fBposition-dependent\fR code are often expensive to relocate. Note, the system
has many caching facilities that help mitigate expenses such as negative path
lookups, and thus employing \fBcrle\fR to create a directory cache may have
minimal effect other than for some very specific cases.
.sp
.LP
When alternate objects that are generated by \fBcrle\fR are specified within a
configuration file, the runtime linker performs some minimal consistency
verification. The alternative objects are verified against their originating
objects. This verification is intended to avert application failure should an
applications configuration information become out-of-sync with the underlying
system components. When this situation arises the flexibility offered by
dynamic linking system components can be compromised. This type of application
failure can be very difficult to diagnose. No verification of directory cache
information is performed. Any changes to the directory structure are not seen
by a process until the cache is rebuilt.
.sp
.LP
System shared objects are often well tuned, and can show little benefit from
being cached. The directory cache and alternative object features are typically
applicable to user applications and shared objects, and may only show
improvement in some very specific cases.
.sp
.LP
\fBcrle\fR creates alternate objects for the shared objects that are discovered
when using the \fB-I\fR and \fB-G\fR options, using \fBdldump\fR(3C). The
alternate object is created in the directory specified by the preceding
\fB-o\fR option, or defaults to the directory in which the configuration file
is created. The flags used by \fBdldump()\fR are specified using the \fB-f\fR
option, or default to \fBRTLD_REL_RELATIVE\fR.

\fB\fB-a\fR \fIname\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Create an alternative path name for \fIname\fR. The alternative path name is
added to the configuration file.
.sp
The actual alternative file must be supplied by the user. Multiple occurrences
of this option are permitted. If \fIname\fR is a directory, each shared object
within the directory is added to the cache. If \fIname\fR does not exist, then
\fIname\fR is marked in the cache as a nonexistent file.
.sp
Typically, this option is used with the \fB-o\fR option.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2

\fB\fB-A\fR \fIname\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Create an optional alternative path name for \fIname\fR. This alternative path
name is added to the configuration file.
.sp
This option mimics the \fB-a\fR option, except that if the alternative is
unavailable at runtime, the original object \fIname\fR is used. This model
mimics the use of auxiliary filters. See \fIGenerating Auxiliary Filters\fR in
\fILinker and Libraries Guide\fR.
.sp
Typically, this option is used with the \fB-o\fR option.

.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specify a \fBreplaceable\fR environment variable, \fIenv\fR. Only environment
variables that are applicable to the runtime linker are meaningful. Multiple
occurrences of this option are permitted. This option is similar to the
\fB-E\fR option. However, the options differs in how configuration file
definitions, and process environment definitions of the same name are resolved
at runtime.
.sp
A definition established in a configuration file can be \fBoverridden\fR by a
process environment definition, or be \fBsuppressed\fR by a null-value process
environment definition.
.sp
In other words, these configuration file definitions can be replaced, or
removed by the process environment at runtime.
.RE

\fB\fB-E\fR \fIenv\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specify a \fBpermanent\fR environment variable, \fIenv\fR. Only environment
variables that are applicable to the runtime linker are meaningful. Multiple
occurrences of this option are permitted. This option is similar to the
\fB-e\fR option. However, the option differs in how configuration file
definitions, and process environment definitions of the same name are resolved
at runtime.
.sp
Environment variable definitions that are meaningful to the runtime linker fall
into one of two categories. Singular definitions are definitions such as
\fBLD_NOLAZYLOAD=1\fR and \fBLD_DEBUG_OUTPUT=\fR\fIfile\fR. List definitions,
which can take one or more values, are definitions such as
\fBLD_LIBRARY_PATH=\fR\fIpath\fR, and \fBLD_DEBUG=\fR\fIfiles\fR,\fIdetails\fR.
.sp
A singular definition that is established in a configuration file takes
precedence over a process environment definition. A list definition that is
established in a configuration file is \fBappended\fR to a process environment
definition. Any definition that is established in a configuration file can
\fBnot\fR be suppressed by a null-value process environment definition.
.sp
In other words, these configuration file definitions can \fBnot\fR be replaced,
or removed by the process environment at runtime.

.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Provide the symbolic \fIflags\fR argument to the \fBdldump\fR(3C) calls used to
generate alternate objects. Any of the \fBRTLD_REL\fR flags that are defined in
\fB/usr/include/dlfcn.h\fR can be used. Multiple flags can be \fBor\fR'ed
together using the "\fB|\fR" character. In this case, the string should be
quoted to avoid expansion by the shell. If no \fIflags\fR values are provided
the default flag is \fBRTLD_REL_RELATIVE\fR.

Add an individual \fIname\fR to the configuration cache. Multiple occurrences
of this option are permitted. \fIname\fR can be a shared object or a directory.
If \fIname\fR is a directory, each shared object within the directory is added
to the cache. If \fIname\fR does not exist, the \fIname\fR is marked in the

alternative created using \fBdldump\fR(3C). If the \fB-f\fR flag contains
\fBRTLD_REL_EXEC\fR, then \fIname\fR can be a dynamic executable, for which an
alternative is created. Only one dynamic executable can be specified in this
manner, as the cache that is created is specific to this application.

\fIname\fR can be a dynamic executable, shared object or a directory. If
\fIname\fR is a shared object, the shared object and its dependencies are added
to the cache. If \fIname\fR is a directory, each shared object within the

that is applicable to the search, is specified by the preceding \fB-t\fR
option, or defaults to \fBELF\fR.
.sp
The default search paths for 32-bit \fBELF\fR objects are \fB/lib\fR followed

The default search paths for \fBAOUT\fR objects are \fB/usr/4lib\fR, followed
by \fB/usr/lib\fR and finally \fB/usr/local/lib\fR.
.sp
Use of this option \fBreplaces\fR the default search path. Therefore, a
\fB-l\fR option is normally required to specify the original system default in
relation to any new paths that are being applied. However, if the \fB-u\fR

With this configuration, a new \fBxterm\fR and its dependencies are created.
These new objects are fully relocated to each other, and result in faster
startup than the originating objects. The execution of this application uses
its own specific configuration file. This model is generally more flexible than
using the environment variable \fBLD_CONFIG\fR, as the configuration file can
not be erroneously used by other applications such as \fBldd\fR(1) or
\fBtruss\fR(1).

With this configuration file, a replaceable search path has been specified
together with a permanent preload object which becomes appended to the process
environment definition.

.SH EXIT STATUS
.LP
The creation or display of a configuration file results in a \fB0\fR being
returned. Otherwise, any error condition is accompanied with a diagnostic
message and a non-zero value being returned.
.SH NOTES
.LP
The ability to tag an alternative application to use an application-specific
configuration file, is possible if the original application contains one of the
\fI\&.dynamic\fR tags \fBDT_FLAGS_1\fR or \fBDT_FEATURE_1\fR. Without these
entries, a configuration file must be specified using the \fBLD_CONFIG\fR
environment variable. Care should be exercised with this latter method as this
environment variable is visible to any forked applications.
.sp
.LP
The use of the \fB-u\fR option requires at least version 2 of \fBcrle\fR. This
version level is evident from displaying the contents of a configuration file.
.sp
.in +2
.nf
$ \fBcrle\fR

Configuration file [2]: /var/ld/ld.config
  ......
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
With a version 2 configuration file, \fBcrle\fR is capable of constructing the
command-line arguments required to regenerate the configuration file. This
command-line construction, provides full update capabilities using the \fB-u\fR
option. Although a version 1 configuration file update is possible, the
configuration file contents might be insufficient for \fBcrle\fR to compute the
entire update requirements.
.sp
.LP
Configuration files contain platform specific binary data. A given
configuration file can only be interpreted by software with the same machine
class and byte ordering. However, the information necessary to enforce this
restriction was not included in configuration files until \fBSXCE\fR build
\fB41\fR. As of this \fBSXCE\fR build, configuration files have system
identification information at the beginning of the file. This additional
information is used by \fBcrle\fR and the runtime to check their compatibility
with configuration files. This information also allows the \fBfile\fR(1)
command to properly identify  configuration files. For backward compatibility,
older files that are missing this information are still accepted, although
without the identification and error checking that would otherwise be possible.
When processing an update (\fB-u\fR) operation for an older file that lacks
system information, \fBcrle\fR does not add system identification information
to the result.
