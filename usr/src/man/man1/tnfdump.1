.SH NAME
tnfdump \- convert binary TNF file to ASCII
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBtnfdump\fR [\fB-r\fR] [\fB-x\fR] \fItnf_file\fR...
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fBtnfdump\fR utility converts the specified binary \fBTNF\fR trace files
to \fBASCII\fR. The \fBASCII\fR output can be used to  do performance analysis.
The default mode (without the \fB-r\fR option) prints all the event records
(that were generated by \fBTNF_PROBE\fR(3TNF)) and the event descriptor records
only. It also orders the events by time.
.SH OPTIONS
.LP
The following option is supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-r\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
Does a raw conversion of \fBTNF\fR to \fBASCII\fR. The output is a literal
transalation of the binary \fBTNF\fR file and includes all the records in the
file. This output is  useful only if you have a good understanding of
\fBTNF\fR. A sample output is listed in EXAMPLES below.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-x\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
Prints all \fBTNF\fR unsigned type argument values in hexadecimal format
instead of decimal format.
.RE

.SH RETURN VALUES
.LP
\fBtnfdump\fR returns \fB0\fR on successful exit.
.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
\fBExample 1 \fRConverting a file into ASCII
.sp
.LP
To convert the file \fB/tmp/trace-2130\fR into \fBASCII\fR, use the
\fBtnfdump\fR command and the name of the binary trace file. Be aware that the
\fBtnfdump\fR output goes to \fBstdout\fR by default.

All probes that are encountered during execution have a description of it
printed out. The description is one per line prefixed by  the
keyword '\fBprobe\fR'. The name of the probe is in double quotes after the
keyword '\fBtnf_name\fR'. The description of this probe is in double quotes after the
keyword '\fBtnf_string\fR'.

.sp
.LP
A heading is printed after all the description of the probes are printed. The
first column gives the elapsed time in milli-seconds since the first event. The
second column gives the elapsed time in milli-seconds since the previous event.
The next four columns are the process id, lwp id, thread id, and cpu number.
The next column is the name of the probe that generated this event. This can be
matched to the probe description explained above. The last column is the data
that the event contains, formatted as \fBarg_name_n\fR \fB(see\fR
\fBTNF_PROBE\fR(3TNF)) followed by a colon and the value of that argument. The
format of the value depends on its type. \fBtnf_opaque\fR arguments are printed
in hexadecimal. All other integers are printed in decimal. Strings are printed
in double quotes and user-defined records are enclosed in braces `{ }'. The
first field of a user defined record indicates its \fBTNF\fR type (see
\fBTNF_DECLARE_RECORD\fR(3TNF)). The rest of the fields are the members of the
record.

.sp
.LP
A `-' in any column indicates that there is no data for that particular column.

The first number is the file offset of the record. The record is enclosed in
braces `{ }'. The first column in a record is the slot name (for records whose
fields do not have names, it is the type name). The second column in the record
is the value of that slot if it is a scalar (only scalars that are of type
\fBtnf_opaque\fR are printed in hex), or the offset of the record if it is a
reference to another record.

.sp
.LP
The third column in a record is optional. It does not exist for scalar slots of
records. If it exists, the third column is a type name with or without angle
brackets, or a string in double quotes. Unadorned names indicate a reference to
the named metatag record (that is, a reference to a record with that name in
the \fBtnf_name\fR field). Type names in angled brackets indicate a reference
to a record that is an instance of that type (that is, a reference to a record
with that name in the \fBtnf_tag\fR field). The content of strings are printed
out in double quotes at the reference site.

.sp
.LP
Records that are arrays have their array elements follow the header slots, and
are numbered 0, 1, 2, and so on, except strings where the string is written as
the 'chars' (pseudo-name) slot.

.sp
.LP
Records that are events (generated by  \fBTNF_PROBE\fR(3TNF)) will have a slot
name of \fBtnf_tag_arg\fR as their second field which is a reference to the
schedule record. Schedule records describe more information about the event
like the thread-id, process-id, and the  \fBtime_base\fR. The \fBtime_delta\fR
of an event can be added to the \fBtime_base\fR of the schedule record that the
event references, to give an absolute time. This time is expressed as
nanoseconds since some arbitrary time in the past (see  \fBgethrtime\fR(3C)).
