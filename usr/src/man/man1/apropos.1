.SH NAME
apropos \- locate commands by keyword lookup
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBapropos\fR \fIkeyword\fR...
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBapropos\fR utility displays the man page name, section number, and a
short description for each man page whose \fBNAME\fR line contains
\fIkeyword\fR. This information is contained in the \fB/usr/share/man/windex\fR
database created by \fBcatman\fR(1M). If \fBcatman\fR(1M) was not run, or was
run with the \fB-n\fR option, \fBapropos\fR fails. Each word is considered
separately and the case of letters is ignored. Words which are part of other
words are considered; for example, when looking for `compile', \fBapropos\fR
finds all instances of `compiler' also.
.sp
.LP
\fBapropos\fR is actually just the \fB-k\fR option to the \fBman\fR(1) command.
