\fBadb\fR [\fB-kw\fR] [\fB-I\fR \fIdir\fR] [\fB-P\fR \fIprompt\fR] [\fB-V\fR \fImode\fR] [\fIobject\fR [\fIcore\fR]]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBadb\fR utility is an interactive, general-purpose debugger. It can be
used to examine files and provides a controlled environment for the execution
of programs.
.sp
.LP
The \fBadb\fR utility is now implemented as a link to the \fBmdb\fR(1) utility.
\fBmdb\fR(1) is a low-level debugging utility that can be used to examine user
processes as well as the live operating system or operating system crash dumps.
The new \fBmdb\fR(1) utility provides complete backwards compatibility with the
existing syntax and features of \fBadb\fR, including support for processing
\fBadb\fR macro files. The \fISolaris Modular Debugger Guide\fR and
\fBmdb\fR(1) man page describes the features of \fBmdb\fR, including its
\fBadb\fR compatibility mode. This mode will be activated by default when the
\fBadb\fR link is executed.
