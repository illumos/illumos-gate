.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fBegrep\fR (\fIexpression grep\fR) utility searches files for a pattern of
characters and prints all lines that contain that pattern. \fBegrep\fR uses
full regular expressions (expressions that have string values that use the full
set of alphanumeric and special characters) to match the patterns. It uses a
fast deterministic algorithm that sometimes needs exponential space.
.sp
.LP
If no files are specified, \fBegrep\fR assumes standard input. Normally, each
line found is copied to the standard output. The file name is printed before
each line found if there is more than one input file.
.LP
The \fBegrep\fR utility accepts the same form of full regular expressions as
\fBgrep\fR(1) -E option.
.sp
.LP
Be careful using the characters \fB$\fR, \fB*\fR, \fB[\fR, \fB^\fR, |, \fB(\fR,
\fB)\fR, and \fB\e\fR in \fIfull regular expression\fR, because they are also
meaningful to the shell. It is safest to enclose the entire \fIfull regular
expression\fR in single quotes (\fBa\'\fR\fBa\'\fR).
.sp
.LP
The order of precedence of operators is \fB[\|]\fR, then \fB*\|?\|+\fR, then
concatenation, then | and NEWLINE.
.SH OPTIONS
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-b\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
Precede each line by the block number on which it was found. This can be useful
in locating block numbers by context (first block is 0).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-c\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
Print only a count of the lines that contain the pattern.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-e\fR \fIpattern_list\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
Search for a \fIpattern_list\fR (\fIfull regular expression\fR that begins with
a \fB\(mi\fR).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-f\fR \fIfile\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
Take the list of \fIfull\fR \fIregular\fR \fIexpressions\fR from \fIfile\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-H\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
Precedes each line by the name of the file containing the matching line.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-h\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
Suppress printing of filenames when searching multiple files.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-i\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
Ignore upper/lower case distinction during comparisons.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-l\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
Print the names of files with matching lines once, separated by NEWLINEs. Does
not repeat the names of files when the pattern is found more than once.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-n\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
Precede each line by its line number in the file (first line is 1).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-q\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
Quiet. Does not write anything to the standard output, regardless of matching
lines. Exits with zero status if an input line is selected.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-s\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
Legacy equivalent of \fB-q\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-v\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
Print all lines except those that contain the pattern.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-x\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
Consider only input lines that use all characters in the line to match an
entire fixed string or regular expression to be matching lines.
.RE

.SH OPERANDS
.LP
The following operands are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fIfile\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 8n
A path name of a file to be searched for the patterns. If no \fIfile\fR
operands are specified, the standard input is used.
.RE

.ne 2
.na
\fB\fIpattern\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 8n
Specify one or more patterns to be used during the search for input. This
operand is treated as if it were specified as \fB-e\fR\fIpattern_list\fR.
.RE

.SH USAGE
.LP
See \fBlargefile\fR(5) for the description of the behavior of \fBegrep\fR when
encountering files greater than or equal to 2 Gbyte ( 2^31 bytes).
.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.LP
See \fBenviron\fR(5) for descriptions of the following environment variables
that affect the execution of \fBegrep\fR: \fBLC_COLLATE\fR, \fBLC_CTYPE\fR,
\fBLC_MESSAGES\fR, and \fBNLSPATH\fR.
.SH EXIT STATUS
.LP
The following exit values are returned:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB0\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 5n
If any matches are found.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB1\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 5n
If no matches are found.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB2\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 5n
For syntax errors or inaccessible files (even if matches were found).
.RE

.SH ATTRIBUTES
.LP
See \fBattributes\fR(5) for descriptions of the following attributes:

.sp
.TS

c | c
l | l .

.SH NOTES
.LP
Ideally there should be only one \fBgrep\fR command, but there is not a single
algorithm that spans a wide enough range of space-time trade-offs.
.sp
.LP
Lines are limited only by the size of the available virtual memory.
.LP
The \fB/usr/bin/egrep\fR utility is identical to \fB/usr/bin/grep\fR
\fB-E\fR. See \fBgrep\fR(1). Portable applications should use
\fB/usr/bin/grep\fR \fB-E\fR.
.LP
In the past the behavior of \fB/usr/xpg4/bin/egrep\fR and
\fB/usr/bin/egrep\fR utilities was different. Now \fB/usr/bin/egrep\fR
is replaced by \fB/usr/xpg4/bin/egrep\fR.
