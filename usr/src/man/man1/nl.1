.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBnl\fR utility reads lines from the named \fIfile\fR, or the standard
input if no \fIfile\fR is named, and reproduces the lines on the standard
output. Lines are numbered on the left in accordance with the command options
in effect.
.sp
.LP
\fBnl\fR views the text it reads in terms of logical pages. Line numbering is
reset at the start of each logical page. A logical page consists of a header, a
body, and a footer section. Empty sections are valid. Different line numbering
options are independently available for header, body, and footer. For example,
\fB-bt\fR (the default) numbers non-blank lines in the body section and does
not number any lines in the header and footer sections.
.sp
.LP
The start of logical page sections are signaled by input lines containing
nothing but the following delimiter character(s):
.sp

.sp
.TS
box;
c | c
l | l .
Line contents	Start Of
_
\e:\e:\e:	header
_
\e:\e:	body
_
\e:	footer
.TE

.sp
.LP
Unless optioned otherwise, \fBnl\fR assumes the text being read is in a single
logical page body.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
Command options may appear in any order and may be intermingled with an
optional file name. Only one file may be named. The specified default is used
when the option is not entered on the command line. \fB/usr/xpg4/bin/nl\fR
options require option arguments.  A \fBSPACE\fR character \fBmay\fR separate
options from option arguments. \fB/usr/bin/nl\fR options  \fBmay\fR have option
arguments. If option-arguments of \fB/usr/bin/nl\fR options are not specified,
these options result in the default. The supported options are:
.sp

\fB\fB-b\fR\fItype\fR\fR

.RE

Default \fItype\fR for logical page body is \fBt\fR (text lines numbered).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-f\fR\fItype\fR\fR

page footer is \fBn\fR (no lines numbered).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-d\fR\fIdelim\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 14n
The two delimiter characters specifying the start of a logical page section may
be changed from the default characters (\e\|:\|) to two user-specified
characters. If only one character is entered, the second character remains the
default character (:). No space should appear between the \fB-d\fR and the
delimiter characters. To enter a backslash, use two backslashes.
.RE

.sp

\fB\fB-h\fR\fItype\fR\fR

.RS 14n

page header is \fBn\fR (no lines numbered).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-i\fR\fIincr\fR\fR

.RS 14n
\fIincr\fR is the increment value used to number logical page lines. Default
\fIincr\fR is \fB1\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-l\fR\fInum\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 14n
\fInum\fR is the number of blank lines to be considered as one. For example,
\fB\(mil2\fR results in only the second adjacent blank being numbered (if the
appropriate \fB-ha\fR, \fB-ba\fR, and/or \fB-fa\fR option is set). Default
\fInum\fR is \fB1\fR.
