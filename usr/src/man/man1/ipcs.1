.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBipcs\fR utility prints information about active inter-process
communication facilities. The information that is displayed is controlled by
the options supplied. Without options, information is printed in short format
for message queues, shared memory, and semaphores that are currently active in
the system.
.SH OPTIONS

\fImtype\fR found on any message queue that the user invoking \fBipcs\fR has
permission to read. If \fImtype\fR is \fB0\fR, all messages are displayed. If
\fImtype\fR is negative, all messages with type less than or equal to the
absolute value of \fImtype\fR are displayed. (See \fBmsgrcv\fR(2) and

The next nine characters are interpreted as three sets of three bits each. The
first set refers to the owner's permissions; the next to permissions of others
in the user-group of the facility entry; and the last to all others. Within
each set, the first character indicates permission to read, the second
character indicates permission to write or alter the facility entry, and the
last character is currently unused.
