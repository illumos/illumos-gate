.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBappcert\fR utility examines an application's conformance to the Solaris
Application Binary Interface (\fBABI\fR). The Solaris \fBABI\fR defines the
runtime library interfaces in Solaris that are safe and stable for application
use. More specifically, \fBappcert\fR identifies any dependencies on unstable
runtime interfaces, as well as certain other risks that could cause the product
to fail to work on a subsequent release of Solaris.
.sp
.LP
\fBappcert\fR checks for:
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
\fIPrivate symbol usage in Solaris  libraries.\fR These are private symbols,
that is, functions or data, that are not intended for developer consumption.
They are interfaces that Solaris libraries use to call one another. These
symbols might change their semantic behavior or even disappear altogether
(so-called  \fBdemoted\fR symbols), so it is a good practice to make sure your
application does not depend upon any of them.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
\fIStatic linking.\fR In particular, this refers to static linking of archives
\fBlibc.a\fR, \fBlibsocket.a\fR, and \fBlibnsl.a\fR, that is, instead of
dynamically linking the corresponding shared object \fB\&.so\fR's. Because the
semantics of private symbol calls from one Solaris library to another can
change from  one release to another, it is not a good practice to hardwire
library code into your binary objects.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
\fIUnbound symbols.\fR These are library symbols (that is, functions or data)
that the dynamic linker could not resolve when \fBappcert\fR was run. This
might be an environment problem (for example, \fBLD_LIBRARY_PATH\fR) or a build
problem (for example, not specifying \fB-l\fR\fIlib\fR and/or \fB-z\fR
\fBdefs\fR with compiling). They are flagged to point these problems out and in
case a more serious problem is indicated.
.RE
.sp
.LP
An entire product can be readily examined by \fBappcert\fR (that is, if the
product is a collection of many programs and supporting shared objects) by
referring \fBappcert\fR to the directories where the product is installed.
.sp
.LP
To perform its task, \fBappcert\fR constructs a profile of interface
dependencies for each object file within the product (whether an executable
object or shared object), to determine all the Solaris system interfaces that
are depended upon. (Notice that \fBappcert\fR uses the Solaris runtime linker
to make this determination.) These dependency profiles are then compared to a
definition of the Solaris \fBABI\fR to identify any interfaces that are Private
(unsafe and unstable for application-level use).
.sp
.LP
\fBappcert\fR generates a simple roll-up report that indicates which of the
product's components, if any, had liabilities and what those liabilities were.
The report aids developers who are examining their product's release-to-release
stability.
.sp
.LP
Notice that \fBappcert\fR produces complete interface dependency information,
both the Public (safe and stable) Solaris interfaces and the Private (non-ABI)
interfaces. This information can also be examined for each product component,
if you want.
.sp
.LP
IMPORTANT: \fBappcert\fR must run in the same environment in which the
application being checked runs. See NOTES.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-B\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 18n
If \fBappcert\fR is run in batch mode, the output report will contain one line
per binary, beginning with \fBPASS\fR if no problems were detected for the
binary, \fBFAIL\fR if any problems were found, or \fBINC\fR if the binary could
not be completely checked. Do not interpret these labels too literally. For
example, \fBPASS\fR just means that none of the \fBappcert\fR warnings were
triggered. These strings are flush left and so can be selected via \fBgrep\fR
\fB^FAIL\fR \fB\&...\fR, and so forth.
.RE

.SH LIMITATIONS
.sp
.LP
If the object file to be examined depends on libraries, those dependencies must
be recorded in it (by using the compiler's \fB-l\fR switch).
.sp
.LP
If the object file to be examined depends on other shared libraries, those
libraries must be accessible via \fBLD_LIBRARY_PATH\fR or \fBRUNPATH\fR when
\fBappcert\fR is run.
.sp
.LP
To check 64-bit applications, the machine must be running the 64-bit Solaris
kernel. See \fBisalist\fR(1). Also, the checks for static linking are currently
not done on 64-bit applications.

.sp
.LP
Other files are temporary files used internally by \fBappcert\fR.
.SH OUTPUT MESSAGES
.SS "Private Symbol Use"
.sp
.LP
Private symbols are functions or data variables in a Solaris library that are
not intended for developer or external use. These symbols are interfaces that
the Solaris libraries use to call and communicate with one another. They are
marked in \fBpvs\fR(1) output with the symbol version name \fBSUNWprivate\fR.
.sp
.LP
Private symbols can change their semantic behavior or even disappear altogether
(\fBdemoted\fR or \fBdeprecated\fR symbols), so your application should not
depend upon any of them.
.SS "Demoted Symbols"
.sp
.LP
Demoted symbols are functions or data variables in a Solaris library that were
once private to that library and have been removed (or possibly scoped local to
the library) in a later Solaris release. If your application directly calls one
of these demoted symbols, it will fail to run (relocation error) on the release
in which the symbol was removed and releases thereafter.
.sp
.LP
In some rare cases, a demoted symbol will return in a later release, but
nevertheless there are still some releases on which the application will not
run.
.sp
.LP
Sun Microsystems Inc. performed most of the library scoping in the transition
from Solaris 2.5.1 to 2.6. This action was done to increase binary stability.
By making these completely internal interfaces invisible (that is, they cannot
be dynamically linked against), a developer cannot accidentally or
intentionally call these interfaces. For more information, see the \fILinker
and Libraries Guide\fR, in particular the chapter on versioning. This document
may be found online at \fBhttp://docs.sun.com\fR.
.SS "Unbound Symbols"
.sp
.LP
Unbound symbols are library symbols (that is, functions or data) referenced by
the application that the dynamic linker could not resolve when \fBappcert\fR
was run. \fBNote:\fR \fBappcert\fR does not actually run your application, so
some aspect of the environment that affects dynamic linking might not be set
properly.
.sp
.LP
Unbound symbols do not necessarily indicate a potential binary stability
problem. They only mean that when \fBappcert\fR was run, the runtime dynamic
linker could not resolve these symbols.
.sp
.LP
Unbound symbols might be due to \fBLD_LIBRARY_PATH\fR not being correctly set.
Make sure it is set, so that all of your binary objects can find all of the
libraries they depend on (either your product's own libraries, Solaris
libraries, or those of a third party). Then re-run \fBappcert\fR.
.sp
.LP
You might find it useful to write a shell script that sets up the environment
correctly and then runs \fBappcert\fR on the binaries you want to check.
.sp
.LP
Another common cause for unbound symbols is when a shared object under test has
not recorded its dynamic dependencies, that is, at build time the \fB-l\fR
switch was \fBnot\fR supplied to the compiler and \fBld\fR(1). So the shared
object requires that the \fBexecutables\fR that link against it have the
correct dependencies recorded.
.sp
.LP
Notice that such a shared object can either be linked in the standard way (that
is, specified at an executable's build time) or dynamically opened (for
example, an executable calls \fBdlopen\fR(3C) on the shared object sometimes
when running). Either case can give rise to unbound symbols when \fBappcert\fR
is run. The former can usually be resolved by setting \fBLD_LIBRARY_PATH\fR
appropriately before running \fBappcert\fR. The latter (\fBdlopen\fR) is
usually difficult to resolve. Under some circumstances, you might be able to
set \fBLD_PRELOAD\fR appropriately to preload the needed libraries, but this
procedure does not always work.
.sp
.LP
How do you know if the environment has been set up correctly so that there will
be no unbound symbols? It must be set up so that running \fBldd\fR \fB-r\fR on
the binary yields no "\fBfile not found\fR" or "\fBsymbol not found\fR" errors.
See \fBld.so.1\fR(1) and \fBldd\fR(1) for more information on dynamic linking.
.sp
.LP
In any event, \fBappcert\fR flags unbound symbols as a warning in case they
might indicate a more serious problem. Unbound symbols can be an indicator of
dependencies on demoted symbols (symbols that have been removed from a library
or scoped local to it). Dependencies on demoted symbols will lead to serious
binary stability problems.
.sp
.LP
However, setting up the environment properly should remove most unbound
symbols. In general, it is good practice to record library dependencies at
build time whenever possible because it helps make the binary object better
defined and self-contained. Also recommended is using the \fB-z\fR \fBdefs\fR
flag when building shared objects, to force the resolution of all symbols
during compilation. See \fBld\fR(1) for more information.
.SS "No Bindings Found"
.sp
.LP
\fBappcert\fR runs \fB/bin/ldd\fR \fB-r\fR on each binary object to be tested.
It sets the environment variable \fBLD_DEBUG\fR="\fBfiles,bindings\fR". (See
\fBldd\fR(1) and \fBld.so.1\fR(1) for more information). If that command fails
for some reason, \fBappcert\fR will have no dynamic symbol binding information
and will find "\fBno bindings\fR".
.sp
.LP
\fBappcert\fR can fail if any of the following is true:
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
The binary object does not have read permission.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
The binary object is SUID or SGID and the user does not have sufficient
privileges.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
The binary object is an executable without the execute permission bit set.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
The binary object is completely statically linked.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
The binary object has no library dependency information recorded.
.RE
.sp
.LP
Other cases exist as well (for example, out of memory). In general, this flag
means that \fBappcert\fR could not completely examine the object due to
permissions or environment. Try to modify the permissions or environment so
that the dynamic bindings can be recorded.
.SS "Obsolete Library"
.sp
.LP
An obsolete library is one whose use is deprecated and that might, in some
future release, be removed from Solaris altogether. \fBappcert\fR flags these
because applications depending on them might not run in future releases of
Solaris. All interfaces, including Private ones, in an obsolete library are
frozen and will not change.
.SS "Use of sys_errlist/sys_nerr"
.sp
.LP
Direct use of the symbols \fBsys_errlist\fR or \fBsys_nerr\fR presents a risk
in which reference might be made past the end of the \fBsys_errlist\fR array.
These symbols are deprecated in 32-bit versions of Solaris and are absent
altogether in 64-bit versions. Use \fBstrerror\fR(3C) instead.
.SS "Use of Strong vs. Weak Symbols"
.sp
.LP
The "strong" symbols (for example, \fB_socket\fR) associated with "weak"
symbols (for example, \fBsocket\fR ) are reserved as private (their behavior
could change in the future). Your application should only directly reference
the weak symbol (usually the strong symbols begin with "\fB_\fR").
.sp
.LP
\fBNote:\fR Under certain build environments, the strong/private symbol
dependency gets recorded into your binary instead of the weak/public one, even
though the source code doesn't appear to reference the private symbol.
Nevertheless, steps should be taken to trace down why this is occurring and fix
the dependency.
.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
\fBappcert\fR needs to run in the same environment in which the application
being checked runs. Otherwise it might not be able to resolve references
correctly to interfaces in the Solaris libraries. Take the following steps:
.RS +4
.TP
1.
Make sure that \fBLD_LIBRARY_PATH\fR and any other aspects of the
environment are set to whatever settings are used when the application is run.
Also make sure that it contains the directories containing any non-Solaris
shared objects that are part of the product, so that they can be found when
referenced.

You might find it useful to write a shell script that sets up the environment
correctly and then runs \fBappcert\fR.
.sp
.LP
Some potential problems that can be encountered are:
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
\fBappcert\fR reports unbound symbols that appear to be part of Solaris
libraries.
.sp
This is probably caused when the application uses \fBdlopen\fR(3C) to access a
shared object that does not have its Solaris dependencies recorded.
\fBappcert\fR cannot resolve symbol use in such cases, since the dynamic linker
is never invoked on the shared object, and there is no other dependency
information that could be used to resolve the Solaris symbol bindings. This can
also occur with non-Solaris symbols.
.sp
To avoid this problem, make sure that when a shared object is built, its
dependencies on Solaris libraries are explicitly recorded by using the
\fB-l\fR\fIlib\fR option on the compile line (see \fBcc\fR(1) and \fBld\fR(1)).
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
\fBappcert\fR reports that the application uses a Solaris private symbol that
is not referenced in the application's source code.
.sp
This problem is most likely due to static linking of a Solaris library that
references that symbol. Since \fBappcert\fR uses the dynamic linker to resolve
symbols, statically linked libraries appear to \fBappcert\fR to be part of the
application code (which, in a sense, they are). This can also sometimes happen
as a result of macro substitution in a Solaris header file.
.sp
To avoid this problem, whenever possible do not statically link Solaris library
archives into your application.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
\fBappcert\fR does not recognize a library as part of Solaris.
.sp
Some obsolete Solaris libraries are so old that they were obsoleted before
their symbols could be versioned. Consequently, \fBappcert\fR cannot recognize
them as being part of Solaris.
.RE
.SH BUGS
.sp
.LP
The use of the terms "\fBpublic\fR" and "\fBprivate\fR" as equivalent to
"\fBstable\fR" and "\fBunstable\fR" is unfortunately somewhat confusing. In
particular, experimental or evolving interfaces are public in the sense that
they are documented and their use is encouraged. But they are unstable, because
an application built with them might not run on subsequent releases. Thus, they
are classified as private for \fBappcert\fR's purposes until they are no longer
evolving. Conversely, obsolete interfaces will eventually disappear, and so are
unstable, even though they have been public and stable in the past and are
still treated as public by \fBappcert\fR. Fortunately, these two situations are
rare.
