.SH NAME
tcopy \- copy a magnetic tape
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBtcopy\fR \fIsource\fR [\fIdestination\fR]
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBtcopy\fR utility copies the magnetic tape mounted on the tape drive
specified by the \fBsource\fR argument. The only assumption made about the
contents of a tape is that there are two tape marks at the end.
.sp
.LP
When only a source drive is specified, \fBtcopy\fR scans the tape, and displays
information about the sizes of records and tape files. If a destination is
specified, \fBtcopy\fR makes a copies the source tape onto the
\fIdestination\fR tape, with blocking preserved. As it copies, \fBtcopy\fR
produces the same output as it does when only scanning a tape.
.sp
.LP
The \fBtcopy\fR utility requires the use of Berkeley-compatible device names.
For example,
.sp
.in +2
.nf
example% \fBtcopy /dev/rmt/1b /dev/rmt/2b\fR
.fi
.in -2

.SH NOTES

\fBtcopy\fR will only run on systems supporting an associated set of
\fBioctl\fR(2) requests.
