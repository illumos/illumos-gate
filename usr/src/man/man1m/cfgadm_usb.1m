.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The Universal Serial Bus (\fBUSB\fR) hardware-specific library
\fB/usr/lib/cfgadm/usb.so.1\fR provides the functionality for administering
\fBUSB\fR devices via the \fBcfgadm\fR(1M) command. \fBcfgadm\fR operates on
attachment points. For details regarding attachment points, refer to
\fBcfgadm\fR(1M).
.sp
.LP
For \fBUSB\fR administration, the only attachment points supported are the
ports of hubs attached to the \fBUSB\fR bus.
.sp
.LP
Attachment points are named through attachment point IDs (\fIap_ids\fR). The
\fBUSB\fR bus is hierarchical, so the \fIap_ids\fR are as well. \fBUSB\fR hubs
have ports, numbered from \fB1\fR to \fIn\fR. All \fBUSB\fR \fIap_ids\fR
consist of a string of the following form:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
usb\fIN\fR/\fIA\fR[.\fIB\fR[.\fIC\fR[...]]]
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
where
.br
.in +2
\fIN\fR is the \fIN\fRth \fBUSB\fR host controller on the system,
.in -2
.br
.in +2
\fIA\fR is port #\fIA\fR on the root (top) hub.
.in -2
.br
.in +2
\fIB\fR is port #\fIB\fR of the hub plugged into port #\fIA\fR of the hub above
it.
.in -2
.br
.in +2
\fIC\fR is port #\fIC\fR of the hub plugged into port #\fIB \fRof the hub above
it, and so forth.
.in -2
.sp
.LP
For example, the first port on the root hub of USB controller \fB0\fR (the only
controller), has a logical \fIap_id\fR:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
usb0/1
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
Similarly, the second port on the first external hub plugged into the first
port on the root hub of the first \fBUSB\fR controller has a logical
\fIap_id\fR:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
usb0/1.2
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
For example, if the \fIap_id\fR is \fBusb0/1.4.3.4\fR, it represents port
\fB4\fR of the hub plugged into port \fB3\fR of the hub plugged into port
\fB4\fR of the hub plugged into port \fB1\fR of the root hub of the first
\fBUSB\fR host controller on the system.

\fBUSB 2.0\fR chips have one \fBEHCI\fR host \fBUSB 2.0\fR host controller and a
number of companion \fBUSB 1.\fR\fIx\fR host controllers (either \fBOHCI\fR or
\fBUHCI\fR host controllers).
.sp
.LP
When a \fBUSB 2.0\fR device has been plugged in, it shows up on the \fBEHCI\fR
logical ports which might not have a \fB1\fR to \fB1\fR mapping to external
physical port numbers on the system.  When a \fBUSB 1.\fR\fIx\fR device is
plugged in, the \fBEHCI\fR host controller reroutes the device to a companion
host controller and the device shows up on  the companion's logical port
number.
.sp
.LP
The mapping of logical port numbers to physical port numbers can get quite
complicated. For example:

The user has physically removed a device while an application had the device

A \fBUSB\fR device can be hotplugged or hotunplugged at any time, and the
system detects the event and takes the appropriate action.
.sp
.LP
It is not necessary to transition a receptacle to the \fBdisconnected\fR state
before removing its device from the \fBUSB\fR. However, it is not recommended
to hot-remove devices currently in use (such as removable disks currently
opened by a volume manager or some other application).
.SH OPTIONS
.LP
\fBcfgadm\fR defines several types of operations. These operations include
invoking configuration state changes (\fB-c\fR), invoking hardware-specific
functions (\fB-x\fR), and obtaining configuration administration help messages
(\fB-h\fR).
.sp
.LP
If any of these operations fail, the device and attachment point might not be
in the expected state. Use the \fBcfgadm\fR \fB-l\fR command to display the
device's current status.
.sp
.LP
All other options have the same meaning as defined in \fBcfgadm\fR(1M).
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-c\fR \fIfunction\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
The following generic commands are defined for the \fBUSB\fR hardware specific
library. The following configuration state change operations are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBconfigure\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
If there is a \fBUSB\fR device plugged into the port, this command attempts to
configure it and set everything up so that it is usable by Solaris. This
command does an implied \fBconnect\fR (reverse of \fBdisconnect\fR) if
necessary. This command accomplishes nothing, and returns an error message, if
the device at that port is already configured. After successful execution of
this command, the device is ready for use under Solaris.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBdisconnect\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Performs an \fBunconfigure\fR on the \fIap_id\fR (if it is not already
\fBunconfigured\fR), and then transitions the receptacle to the
\fBdisconnected\fR state, even though a device is still be plugged into the
port. Issuing a \fBcfgadm\fR \fB-c\fR \fBconfigure\fR, or physically
hotplugging the device, brings the device back to the \fBconnected\fR
receptacle state, and to the \fBconfigured\fR occupant state, assuming a driver
can be found and there are no problems enumerating and configuring the device.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBunconfigure\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Makes the device plugged into the port unusable by Solaris (offline it). If
successful, \fBcfgadm\fR reports this \fIap_id\fR's occupant state as
\fBunconfigured\fR. Issuing a \fBconfigure\fR to the \fIap_id\fR (if
successful) brings its occupant back to the \fBconfigured\fR (online)
condition, as it physically hotplugging the device on the port.

.sp .6
.RS 4n
This command requires the mandatory \fBconfig\fR value to be specified using
the \fB-o\fR option.
.sp
Sets the \fBUSB\fR configuration of a multi-configuration \fBUSB\fR device at
\fIap_id\fR to configuration index \fIn\fR. The device is set to this
configuration henceforth and this setting persists across reboots, hot-removes,
and unconfigure/configure of the device.
.sp
Valid values of \fIn\fR range from \fB0\fR to (\fBNconfigs -1\fR). The device
is reset by a \fBdisconnect\fR followed by a \fBconfigure\fR. The
\fBconfigure\fR causes the device to be configured to the new configuration
setting.
.sp
If any of these steps fail, the configuration file and the device are restored
to their previous state and an error message is issued.

\fB\fBusb_reset\fR\fR

.RS 4n
Performs a software reset (re-enumeration) of the device. This is the
equivalent of removing the device and inserting it back again. The port on the
hub is power cycled if the hub supports power cycling of individual ports.
.sp
If the connected device is a hub, this function has the effect of resetting
that hub and any devices down the tree of which it is the root.
.sp
If any of these steps fail, the device is restored to its previous state and an
error message is issued.

\fBExample 5 \fRUnconfiguring and Logically Disconnecting an Existing USB

attached to \fBusb0/1.3\fR:

.sp

example# \fBcfgadm -c disconnect usb0/1.3\fR
Disconnect the device: /devices/pci@0,0/pci8086,7112@7,2/hub@2:2.3

A \fBdisconnect\fR implies that \fBcfgadm\fR does an \fBunconfigure\fR first.
The receptacle status now shows \fBdisconnected\fR, even though the device is
still physically connected. In this case, a physical hotplug or using the
\fBcfgadm \fR\fB-c\fR \fBconfigure\fR on the \fBap_id\fR brings it back
on-line.
