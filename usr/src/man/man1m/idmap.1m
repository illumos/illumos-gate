.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBidmap\fR utility is used to configure and manage the Native Identity
Mapping service.
.sp
.LP
The Native Identity Mapping service supports the following types of mappings
between Windows security identities (SIDs) and POSIX user IDs and group IDs
(UIDs and GIDs):
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
\fBName-based mapping.\fR An administrator maps Windows and UNIX users and
groups by name.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
\fBEphemeral ID mapping.\fR A UID or GID is dynamically allocated for every SID
that is not already mapped by name.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
\fBLocal-SID mapping.\fR A non-ephemeral UID or GID is mapped to an
algorithmically generated local SID.
.RE
.sp
.LP
The \fBidmap\fR utility can be used to create and manage the name-based
mappings and to monitor the mappings in effect.
.sp
.LP
If the \fBidmap\fR utility is invoked without a subcommand or option, it reads
the subcommands from standard input. When standard input is a TTY, the
\fBidmap\fR command prints the usage message and exits.
.SS "Mapping Mechanisms"
.sp
.LP
The \fBidmapd\fR(1M) daemon maps Windows user and group SIDs to UNIX UIDs and
GIDs as follows:
.RS +4
.TP
1.
SIDs are mapped by name.
.sp
This mapping uses the name-based mappings that are manually set up by the
system administrator.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
2.
If no name-based mapping is found, the SID is mapped to a dynamically
allocated ephemeral ID.
.sp
This allocation uses the next available UID or GID from 2^31 to 2^32 - 2.
.RE
.sp
.LP
Local SID mappings are used to map from UNIX to Windows.
.sp
.LP
To prevent aliasing problems, all file systems, archive and backup formats, and
protocols must store SIDs or map all UIDs and GIDs in the 2^31 to 2^32 - 2
range to the \fBnobody\fR user and group.
.sp
.LP
It is possible to create also diagonal mappings. They are the mappings between
Windows groups and Solaris users and between Solaris groups and Windows users.
They are needed when Windows uses a group identity as a file owner or vice
versa.
.SS "Name-based Mappings"
.sp
.LP
Name-based mappings establish name equivalence between Windows users and groups
and their counterparts in the UNIX name service. These mappings persist across
reboots. For example, the following command maps Windows users to UNIX users
with the same name:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
# \fBidmap add "winuser:*@mywindomain.com" "unixuser:*"\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
If configured to use a directory service, \fBidmapd\fR(1M) will first try to
use the mapping information that is stored in user or group objects in the
Active Directory (AD) and/or the native LDAP directory service. For example, an
AD object for a given Windows user or group can be augmented to include the
corresponding Solaris user or group name or numeric id. Similarly, the native
LDAP object for a given Solaris user or group can be augmented to include the
corresponding Windows user or group name.
.sp
.LP
\fBidmapd\fR(1M) can be configured to use AD and/or native LDAP directory-based
name mappings by setting the appropriate service management facility (SMF)
properties of the \fBidmap\fR service. See "Service Properties," below, for
more details.
.sp
.LP
If directory-based name mapping is not configured or if configured but not
found, then \fBidmapd\fR(1M) will process locally stored name-based mapping
rules.
.sp
.LP
\fBidmap\fR supports the mapping of Windows well-known names. A few of these
are listed below:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
Administrator
Guest
KRBTGT
Domain Admins
Domain Users
Domain Guest
Domain Computers
Domain Controllers
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
When \fBidmap\fR rules are added, these well-known names will be expanded to
canonical form. That is, either the default domain name will be added (for
names that are not well-known) or an appropriate built-in domain name will be
added. Depending on the particular well-known name, this domain name might be
null, \fBBUILTIN\fR, or the local host name.
.sp
.LP
The following sequence of \fBidmap\fR commands illustrate the treatment of the
non-well-known name \fBfred\fR and the well-known names \fBadministrator\fR and
\fBguest\fR.
.sp
.in +2
.nf
# \fBidmap add winname:fred unixuser:fredf\fR
add     winname:fred    unixuser:fredf

# \fBidmap add winname:administrator unixuser:root\fR
add     winname:administrator   unixuser:root

# \fBidmap add winname:guest unixuser:nobody\fR
add     winname:guest   unixuser:nobody

# \fBidmap add wingroup:administrators sysadmin\fR
add     wingroup:administrators unixgroup:sysadmin

# \fBidmap list\fR
add     winname:Administrator@examplehost  unixuser:root
add     winname:Guest@examplehost  unixuser:nobody
add     wingroup:Administrators@BUILTIN unixgroup:sysadmin
add     winname:fred@example.com       unixuser:fredf
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.SS "Ephemeral Mappings"
.sp
.LP
The \fBidmapd\fR daemon attempts to preserve ephemeral ID mappings across
daemon restarts. However, when IDs cannot be preserved, the daemon maps each
previously mapped SID to a new ephemeral UID or GID value. The daemon will
never re-use ephemeral UIDs or GIDs. If the \fBidmapd\fR daemon runs out of
ephemeral UIDs and GIDs, it returns an error as well as a default UID or GID
for SIDs that cannot be mapped by name.
.sp
.LP
The dynamic ID mappings are not retained across reboots. So, any SIDs that are
dynamically mapped to UNIX UIDs or GIDs are most likely mapped to different IDs
after rebooting the system.
.SS "Local SID Mappings"
.sp
.LP
If no name-based mapping is found, a non-ephemeral UID or GID is mapped to an
algorithmically generated local SID. The mapping is generated as follows:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
local SID for UID = \fI<machine SID>\fR - \fI<1000 + UID>\fR
local SID for GID = \fI<machine SID>\fR - \fI<2^31 + GID>\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
\fI<machine SID>\fR is a unique SID generated by the \fBidmap\fR service for
the host on which it runs.
.SS "Rule Lookup Order"
.sp
.LP
When mapping a Windows name to a UNIX name, lookup for name-based mapping rules
is performed in the following order:
.RS +4

.SS "Service Properties"
.sp
.LP
The service properties determine the behavior of the \fBidmapd\fR(1M) daemon.
These properties are stored in the SMF repository (see \fBsmf\fR(5)) under
property group \fBconfig\fR. They can be accessed and modified using
\fBsvccfg\fR(1M), which requires \fBsolaris.smf.value.idmap\fR authorization.
The service properties for the \fBidmap\fR service are:
.sp

\fBnone\fR disables directory-based mapping.
.sp
\fBname\fR enables name-based mapping using the properties described above.
.sp
\fBidmu\fR enables mapping using Microsoft's Identity Management for UNIX
(IDMU). This Windows component allows the administrator to specify a UNIX user
ID for each Windows user, mapping the Windows identity to the corresponding
UNIX identity. Only IDMU data from the domain the Solaris system is a member of
is used.
.RE

.sp
.LP
Changes to service properties do not affect a running \fBidmap\fR service. The
service must be refreshed (with \fBsvcadm\fR(1M)) for the changes to take
effect.
.SH OPERANDS
.sp
.LP
The \fBidmap\fR command uses the following operands:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fIformat\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specifies the format in which user name mappings are described for the
\fBexport\fR and \fBimport\fR subcommands. The Netapp \fBusermap.cfg\fR and
Samba \fBsmbusers\fR external formats are supported. These external formats are
\fBonly\fR for users, not groups.
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
The \fBusermap.cfg\fR rule-mapping format is as follows:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fIwindows-username\fR [\fIdirection\fR] \fIunix-username\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

\fIwindows-username\fR is a Windows user name in either the
\fIdomain\fR\e\fIusername\fR or \fIusername\fR\fB@\fR\fIdomain\fR format.
.sp
\fIunix-username\fR is a UNIX user name.
.sp
.LP
\fIdirection\fR is one of the following:
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
\fB==\fR means a bidirectional mapping, which is the default.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
\fB=>\fR or \fB<=\fR means a unidirectional mapping.
.RE
The IP qualifier is not supported.
.RE
.RS +4

The \fBsmbusers\fR rule-mapping format is as follows:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fIunixname\fR = \fIwinname1\fR \fIwinname2\fR ...
.fi
.in -2
.sp

If \fIwinname\fR includes whitespace, escape the whitespace by enclosing the
value in double quotes. For example, the following file shows how to specify
whitespace in a valid format for the \fBidmap\fR command:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
$ \fBcat myusermap\fR
terry="Terry Maddox"
pat="Pat Flynn"
cal=cbrown
.fi
.in -2
.sp

The mappings are imported as unidirectional mappings from Windows names to UNIX
names.
.sp
The format is based on the "username map" entry of the \fBsmb.conf\fR man page,
which is available on the \fBsamba.org\fR web site. The use of an asterisk
(\fB*\fR) for \fIwindows-name\fR is supported. However, the \fB@group\fR
directive and the chaining of mappings are not supported.
.sp
By default, if no mapping entries are in the \fBsmbusers\fR file, Samba maps a
\fIwindows-name\fR to the equivalent \fIunix-name\fR, if any. If you want to
set up the same mapping as Samba does, use the following \fBidmap\fR command:
.sp
.in +2

If \fIname\fR is the empty string (\fB""\fR), mapping is inhibited. Note that a
name of \fB""\fR should not be used to preclude logins by unmapped Windows
users.
.sp
If \fIname\fR uses the wildcard (\fB*\fR), it matches all names that are not
matched by other mappings. Similarly, if \fIname\fR is the wildcard Windows
name (\fB*@*\fR), it matches all names in all domains that are not matched by
other mappings.
.sp
If \fIname\fR uses the wildcard on both sides of the mapping rule, the name is
the same for both Windows and Solaris users. For example, if the rule is
\fB"*@domain" == "*"\fR, the \fBjp@domain\fR Windows user name matches this
rule and maps to the \fBjp\fR Solaris user name.

.sp
.LP
The \fBidmapd\fR service is managed by the service management facility,
\fBsmf\fR(5). The service identifier for the \fBidmapd\fR service is
\fBsvc:/system/idmap\fR.
.sp
.LP
Use the \fBsvcadm\fR command to perform administrative actions on this service,
such as enabling, disabling, or restarting the service. These actions require
the \fBsolaris.smf.manage.idmap\fR authorization. Use the \fBsvcs\fR command to
query the service's status.
.sp
.LP
Windows user names are case-insensitive, while UNIX user names are
case-sensitive. The case of Windows names as they appear in \fBidmap\fR
name-rules and \fBidmap show\fR command lines is irrelevant.
.sp
.LP
Because common practice in UNIX environments is to use all-lowercase user
names, wildcard name-rules map Windows names to UNIX user/group names as
follows: first, the canonical Windows name (that is, in the case as it appears
in the directory) is used as a UNIX user or group name. If there is no such
UNIX entity, then the Windows name's case is folded to lowercase and the result
is used as the UNIX user or group name.
.sp
.LP
As a result of this differing treatment of case, user names that appear to be
alike might not be recognized as matches. You must create rules to handle such
pairings of strings that differ only in case. For example, to map the Windows
user \fBsam@example\fR to the Solaris user \fBSam\fR, you must create the
following rules:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
# \fBidmap add "winuser:*@example" "unixuser:*"\fR
# \fBidmap add winuser:sam@example unixuser:Sam\fR
