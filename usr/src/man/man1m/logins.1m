following: login id, user id, primary group name, primary group id and the
account field value. Output is sorted by user id, system logins, followed by
user logins.

password or any of the above entries. See \fBcrypt\fR(3C) for valid password
hashes.
.RE

If the login is passworded, status is followed by the date the password was
last changed, the number of days required between changes, and the number of
days allowed before a change is required. The password aging information shows
the time interval that the user receives a password expiration warning message
(when logging on) before the password expires.
