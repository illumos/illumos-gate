.SH NAME
ntfscluster \- identify files in a specified region of an NTFS volume
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBntfscluster\fR [\fIoptions\fR] \fIdevice\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBntfscluster\fR utility has three modes of operation: \fBinfo\fR,
\fBsector\fR, and \fBcluster\fR, described as follows.
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBInfo\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
The default mode, \fBinfo\fR is currently not implemented. It will display
general information about the NTFS volume when it is working.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBSector\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
The \fBsector\fR mode displays a list of files that have data in the specified
range of sectors. This mode is put in effect by the \fB--sector\fR option.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBCluster\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
The \fBcluster\fR mode displays a list of files that have data in the specified
range of clusters. When the cluster size is one sector, this is equivalent to
the \fBsector\fR mode of operation. This mode is put in effect by the
\fB--cluster\fR option.
.RE

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
Supported options are listed below. Most options have both single-letter and
full-name forms. Multiple single-letter options that do not take an argument
can be combined. For example, \fB-fv\fR is the equivalent of \fB-f\fR \fB-v\fR.
A full-name option can be abbreviated to a unique prefix of its name.
