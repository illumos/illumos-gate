.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBmetaclear\fR command deletes the specified metadevice or
\fIhot_spare_pool\fR, or purges all soft partitions from the designated
component. Once a metadevice or hot spare pool is deleted, it must be
re-created using \fBmetainit\fR before it can be used again.
.sp
.LP
Any metadevice currently in use (open) cannot be deleted.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
Root privileges are required for all of the following options except \fB-h\fR.
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-a\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 14n
Deletes all metadevices and configured hot spare pools in the set named by
\fB-s\fR, or the local set by default.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-f\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 14n
Deletes (forcibly) a metadevice that contains a subcomponent in an error state.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-h\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 14n
Displays usage message.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-p\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 14n
Deletes (purges) all soft partitions from the specified metadevice or
component.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-r\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 14n
Recursively deletes specified metadevices and hot spare pools, but does not
delete metadevices on which others depend.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-s\fR \fB\fIsetname\fR\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 14n
Specifies the name of the diskset on which \fBmetaclear\fR will work. Using the
\fB-s\fR option causes the command to perform its administrative function
within the specified diskset. Without this option, the command performs its
function on local metadevices and/or hot spare pools.
.RE

.SH OPERANDS
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fImetadevice\fR \fI\&...\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 24n
Specifies the name(s) of the metadevice(s) to be deleted.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fIcomponent\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 24n
Specifies the \fBc*d*t*s*\fR name(s) of the components containing soft
partitions to be deleted.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fIhot_spare_pool\fR \fI\&...\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 24n
Specifies the name(s) of the hot spare pools to be deleted. Names for hot spare
pools can be any legal file name that is composed of alphanumeric characters, a
dash ("-"), an underscore ("_"), or a period ("."). Names must begin with a
letter. The words "all" and "none" are reserved and cannot be used.
