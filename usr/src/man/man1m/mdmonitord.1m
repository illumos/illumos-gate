.SH NAME
mdmonitord \- daemon to monitor metadevices
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/usr/sbin/mdmonitord\fR [\fB-t\fR \fItime_interval\fR]
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBmdmonitord\fR utility is part of Solaris Volume Manager. It monitors and
checks RAID1 (mirrors), RAID5 and hot spares.
.sp
.LP
There are two methods for checking:
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
At fixed time intervals.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
When a RAID-1 (mirror), RAID-5, or hot spare fails. A failure generates  an
error event which triggers a check of these metadevices.
.RE
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-t\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
Time interval in seconds.  The default value is 0, which causes probes to occur
only upon an error. If you want to run \fBmdmonitord\fR at a regular interval,
a value of 1800 (seconds, every half hour) is recommended as a starting point.
.RE

.SH EXIT STATUS
.sp
.LP
The following exit values are returned:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB0\fR\fR
.ad

Since frequent probes can affect performance, it is recommended that the
intervals between probes be limited.
.sp
