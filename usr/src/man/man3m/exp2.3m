.SH NAME
exp2, exp2f, exp2l \- exponential base 2 functions
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
c99 [ \fIflag\fR... ] \fIfile\fR... \fB-lm\fR [ \fIlibrary\fR... ]
#include <math.h>

\fBdouble\fR \fBexp2\fR(\fBdouble\fR \fIx\fR);
.fi

.LP
.nf
\fBfloat\fR \fBexp2f\fR(\fBfloat\fR \fIx\fR);
.fi

.LP
.nf
\fBlong double\fR \fBexp2l\fR(\fBlong double\fR \fIx\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
These functions compute the base-2 exponential of \fIx\fR.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, these functions return 2^\fIx\fR.
.sp
.LP
If the correct value would cause overflow, a range error occurs and
\fBexp2()\fR, \fBexp2f()\fR, and \fBexp2l()\fR return the value of the macro
\fBHUGE_VAL\fR, \fBHUGE_VALF\fR, and \fBHUGE_VALL\fR, respectively.
.sp
.LP
If \fIx\fR is NaN, a NaN is returned.
.sp
.LP
If \fIx\fR is \(+-0, 1 is returned.
.sp
.LP
If \fIx\fR is \(miInf, +0 is returned.
.sp
.LP
If \fIx\fR is +Inf, \fIx\fR is returned.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
These functions will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBRange Error\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
The result overflows.
.sp
If the integer expression (\fBmath_errhandling\fR & \fBMATH_ERREXCEPT\fR) is
non-zero, the overflow floating-point exception will be raised.
.RE

.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
An application wanting to check for exceptions should call
\fBfeclearexcept\fR(\fBFE_ALL_EXCEPT\fR) before calling these functions. On
return, if \fBfetestexcept\fR(\fBFE_INVALID\fR | \fBFE_DIVBYZERO\fR |
\fBFE_OVERFLOW\fR | \fBFE_UNDERFLOW\fR) is non-zero, an exception has been
raised. An application should either examine the return value or check the
floating point exception flags to detect exceptions.
