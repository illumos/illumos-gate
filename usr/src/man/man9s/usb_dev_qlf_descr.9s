.SH NAME
usb_dev_qlf_descr \- USB device qualifier descriptor
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <sys/usb/usba.h>
.fi

.SH INTERFACE LEVEL
illumos DDI specific (illumos DDI)
.SH DESCRIPTION
The device qualifier descriptor \fBusb_dev_qlf_descr_t\fR defines how fields of
a high speed device's device descriptor would look if that device is run at a
different speed.  If a high-speed device is running currently at full/high
speed, fields of this descriptor reflect how device descriptor fields would
look if speed was changed to high/full. Please refer to section \fI9.6.2\fR of
the \fIUSB 2.0\fR specification. The \fIUSB 2.0\fR specification is available
at \fIwww.usb.org\fR.
