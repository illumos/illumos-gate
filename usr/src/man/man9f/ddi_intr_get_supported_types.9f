.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBddi_intr_get_supported_types()\fR function retrieves the interrupt types
supported by a particular hardware device and by the system software. Upon
successful return, the supported types are returned as a bit mask in the
integer pointed to by the \fItypesp\fR argument. See <\fBsys/ddi_intr.h\fR> for
a list of interrupts that can be returned by a hardware device.
.sp
.LP
For PCI devices that support MSI and/or MSI-X based hardware, this interface
returns only the interrupt types that are supported by all the hardware in the
path to the hardware device.
.sp
.LP
An interrupt type is usable by the hardware device if it is returned by the
\fBddi_intr_get_supported_types()\fR function. The device driver can be
programmed to use one of the returned interrupt types to receive hardware
interrupts.
.SH RETURN VALUES

The \fBddi_intr_get_supported_types()\fR function returns:
.sp
.ne 2

\fB\fBDDI_SUCCESS\fR\fR

On success.
.RE

.sp

\fB\fBDDI_EINVAL\fR\fR

On encountering invalid input parameters.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBDDI_INTR_NOTFOUND\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 21n
.rt  
Returned when the hardware device is found not to support any hardware
interrupts.

.SH CONTEXT
.sp
.LP
The \fBddi_intr_get_supported_types()\fR function can be called from user or
kernel non-interrupt context.

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
The \fBddi_intr_get_supported_types()\fR function can be called by the device
driver even at any time if the driver has added an interrupt handler for a
given interrupt type.
.sp
.LP
Soft interrupts are always usable and are not returned by this interface.
.sp
.LP
Any consumer of this interface should verify that the return value is not equal
to \fBDDI_SUCCESS\fR. Incomplete checking for failure codes could result in
inconsistent behavior among platforms.
