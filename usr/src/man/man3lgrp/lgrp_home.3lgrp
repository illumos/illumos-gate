.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBlgrp_home()\fR function returns the ID of the home lgroup for the given
process or thread.  A thread can have an affinity for an lgroup in the system
such that the thread will tend to be scheduled to run on that lgroup and
allocate memory from there whenever possible.  The lgroup with the strongest
affinity that the thread can run on is known as the "home lgroup" of the
thread.  If the thread has no affinity for any lgroup that it can run on, the
operating system will choose a home for it.
.sp
.LP
The \fIidtype\fR argument should be \fBP_PID\fR to specify a process and the
\fIid\fR argument should be its process ID.  Otherwise, the \fIidtype\fR
argument should be \fBP_LWPID\fR to specify a thread and the \fIid\fR argument
should be its LWP ID. The value \fBP_MYID\fR can be used for the \fIid\fR
argument to specify the current process or thread.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fBlgrp_home()\fR returns the ID of the home lgroup
of the specified process or thread. Otherwise, \(mi1 is returned and
\fBerrno\fR is set to indicate the error.
