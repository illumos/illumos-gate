.Sh NAME
.Nm pr_setitimer
.Nd inject setitimer system call into victim process
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Lb libproc
.In libproc.h
.Ft int
.Fo pr_setitimer
.Fa "struct ps_prochandle *P"
.Fa "int which"
.Fa "const struct itimerval *itv"
.Fa "struct interval *oitv"
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn pr_setitimer
function injects the
.Xr setitimer 2
system call into the target process
.Fa P
by means of the agent LWP.
If the process handle
.Fa P
is the value
.Dv NULL
then this will be equivalent to calling
.Xr setitimer 2
on the currently running process.
.Pp
The arguments
.Fa which ,
.Fa itv ,
and
.Fa oitv
have the same meaning as in
.Xr setitimer 2 .
See
.Xr setitimer 2
for the full description and purpose of the
.Sy setitimer
system call and its arguments.
.Pp
The
.Fn pr_setitimer
function only works on active processes. Process handles that correspond
to core files, zombie processes, or ELF objects do not support system
call injection.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion, the
.Fn pr_setitimer
function's return value is that described in
.Xr setitimer 2 .
Otherwise,
.Sy -1
is returned and
.Sy errno
is set to
.Er ENOSYS
to indicate that the system call could not be injected.
.Sh ERRORS
For the full list of errors see the
.Sy ERRORS
section in
.Xr setitimer 2 .
.Pp
The
.Fn pr_setitimer
function will fail if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Er ENOSYS
An error occurred while trying to invoke the agent LWP and inject a
system call in the process handle
.Fa P
or the process handle
.Fa P
does not support system call injection.
