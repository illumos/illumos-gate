.Sh NAME
.Nm eventfd
.Nd Linux-compatible user event notification facility
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/eventfd.h
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a Linux-borne facility for sending and receiving user
events via a file descriptor.  While the facility itself is somewhat dubious
(it can be mimicked in an entirely portable way with a pipe), it is
small and straightforward and this implementation is entirely compatible
with its Linux antecedent; see
.Xr eventfd 3C
for details.
