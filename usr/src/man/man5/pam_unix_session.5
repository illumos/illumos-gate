.SH NAME
pam_unix_session \- session management PAM module for UNIX
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBpam_unix_session.so.1\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fBpam_unix_session\fR module implements \fBpam_sm_open_session\fR(3PAM)
and \fBpam_sm_close_session\fR(3PAM).
.sp
.LP
\fBpam_sm_open_session()\fR reads \fB/var/adm/lastlog.v2\fR to report the
user's last login time via a PAM_TEXT_INFO message as well as updates the file
with information contained in the \fBPAM_USER\fR, \fBPAM_TTY\fR, and
\fBPAM_RHOSTS\fR items.  \fBpam_unix_account\fR(5) also uses this file to
determine the previous time the user logged in.
.sp
.LP
\fBpam_sm_close_session()\fR is a null function.
.sp
.LP
The following options can be passed to the module:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fBdebug\fR
.ad
.RS 9n
\fBsyslog\fR(3C) debugging information at the \fBLOG_DEBUG\fR level
.RE

.SH ERRORS
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fBPAM_SUCCESS\fR is returned. The following error
codes are returned upon error:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBPAM_SESSION_ERR\fR\fR
.ad

.SH NOTES
.LP
The interfaces in \fBlibpam\fR(3LIB) are MT-Safe only if each thread within the
multi-threaded application uses its own PAM handle.

.LP
The \fBpam_unix\fR(5) module is no longer supported. Similar functionality is
provided by \fBpam_authtok_check\fR(5), \fBpam_authtok_get\fR(5),
\fBpam_authtok_store\fR(5), \fBpam_dhkeys\fR(5), \fBpam_passwd_auth\fR(5),
\fBpam_unix_account\fR(5), \fBpam_unix_auth\fR(5), and
\fBpam_unix_session\fR(5).
