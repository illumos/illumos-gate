.SH NAME
smf_template \- service management framework support for service metadata
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
Templates are defined by service developers to describe metadata about a
service in general or individual configuration properties on a service,
including human-consumable descriptions as well as definitions of valid
configuration.
.sp
.LP
Administrators are provided access to templates through SMF commands that
describe configuration values and validate configuration against templates.
.sp
.LP
Tool developers can use templates to provide more helpful user interfaces for
service configuration.
.SS "Template Data"
.sp
.LP
Service metadata is defined in the template as part of the service manifest.
.SS "Consuming Template Data"
.sp
.LP
The \fBsvcs -lv\fR and \fBsvccfg describe\fR commands can be used to access
metadata about properties in a human-readable format.
.sp
.LP
\fBsvccfg\fR(1M)'s \fBvalidate\fR subcommand can be used to validate a service
instance or manifest against template data. A set of \fBlibscf\fR(3LIB)
interfaces is available to access template data.
.SS "Template Definition"
.sp
.LP
The sole interface to define templates is the service manifest.
.sp
.LP
Service authors should provide template metadata including \fBcommon_names\fR,
\fBdescriptions\fR, \fBchoices\fR and \fBconstraints\fR for service-specific
property groups and properties which they introduce. At a minimum, service
authors must provide descriptions for property groups and properties in the C
locale. Service authors should not provide template metadata for
framework-delivered property groups such as methods and dependencies.
.sp
.LP
See the \fBEXAMPLES\fR section for an example of authoring a template
definition for a service.
.SS "Template Composition"
.sp
.LP
All template interfaces search for template data about a property group first
on the instance, then on the service, then on the service's restarter, and
finally globally.
.sp
.LP
A property group template is defined by its author to apply to a specific
instance, to a service and all of its instances, to a restarter's delegates, or
globally. A typical service author defines the template on an instance or on a
service. A template defined on an instance is applied to that instance only,
and can override a template for that property group defined on the service. A
template defined on the service is applied to all instances of that service.
.sp
.LP
Restarter authors can define templates in their manifest that apply to any
service which uses their restarter, which is also known as a \fBdelegate\fR.
SMF framework authors have defined templates for property groups with
well-known meanings to the entire SMF framework in the manifest for
\fBsvc:/system/svc/global\fR.
.sp
.LP
Templates defined globally or by the restarter and re-defined by the service or
instance are flagged as a validation error. Service authors can avoid these
errors by creating templates only for property groups specific to their service
and not consumed by the SMF framework.
.sp
.LP
Property group templates can also be wildcarded by name or type. Only the most
specific template definition applicable to a property group is honored.
.SS "Template Details"
.SS "Service and Instance Templates"
.sp
.LP
The \fBtemplate\fR element defines the start of a template block. All further
definitions below can be included in a template block. A \fBtemplate\fR element
can be contained in either a \fBservice\fR or \fBinstance\fR element. If it is
contained in the \fBservice\fR element, it applies to the service and all
instances of that service. If it is contained in the \fBinstance\fR element, it
applies to only that instance of the service.
.sp
.LP
Whenever possible, we recommend defining the template data for the entire
service.

.SS "Service and Instance Common Names"
.sp
.LP
The entire service or instance can define a common name to describe the purpose
of the service/instance.
.sp
.in +2
.nf
<template>
  <common_name>
      <loctext xml:lang='C'>console login</loctext>

\fIcommon_name\fR is a free-form string, but is intended to be used as a label
in a GUI or CLI.
.sp
.LP

.SS "Documentation"
.sp
.LP
Documentation for this service can be defined explicitly, so that when the
service is experiencing issues, or a consumer of the service wants more
information on it, they can find it easily.
.sp
.LP
Documentation can include man pages or references to stable URLs for reference
documentation.
.sp
.in +2

.SS "Property Groups"
.sp
.LP
The \fBpg_pattern\fR element contains the definitions for a property group:

.in +2
.nf
<template>
  <pg_pattern name="pgname" type="pgtype" target="this" required="true">
  </pg_pattern>
</template>
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
\fIname\fR is the property group's name, and \fItype\fR is the property group's
type.
.sp
.LP
\fItarget\fR specifies what the target of this definition is. \fB"this"\fR
would refer to the defining service or instance. \fB"instance"\fR can only be
used in a service's template block, and means the definition applies to all
instances of this service. \fB"delegate"\fR can only be used in a restarter's
template block, and applies to all instances that are delegated to that
restarter. \fB"all"\fR, only usable by the master restarter, would refer to all
services on the system. The default value of target is \fB"this"\fR.
.sp
.LP
\fBrequired\fR indicates whether this property group is required or not. The
default value of required is \fBfalse\fR. If \fBrequired\fR is \fBtrue\fR, both
\fIname\fR and \fItype\fR must be specified.
.sp
.LP
\fIname\fR and/or \fItype\fR can be omitted. If either of these attributes is
omitted it is treated as a wildcard. For instance, if the name attribute is
omitted from the \fBpg_pattern\fR definition, the \fBpg_pattern\fR is applied
to all property groups that have the specified type.
.SS "Property Group Names"
.sp
.LP
The \fIcommon_name\fR element contains the localized, human-readable name for
the property group:

Some properties are internal implementation details and should not be presented
as a configuration setting. Others might merely be read-only. This property is
used to specify these restrictions. A value of hidden indicates that the
property shouldn't be displayed, \fBreadonly\fR means that the property isn't
intended to be modified, and \fBreadwrite\fR indicates the property is
modifiable.
.sp
.LP
This is not a security mechanism, it is solely intended to help prevent the
user from shooting himself in the foot, and to remove unnecessary clutter from
CLI output or a GUI display. Hidden properties is visible in full-disclosure
modes of many commands and UIs.

\fIcardinality\fR indicates the acceptable number of property values. \fImin\fR

or more values.

\fIinternal_separators\fR specify the separator characters used for those

\fIvalue\fR and \fIrange\fR can be used in any combination, as restricting
their use would prohibit many valid descriptions. If no value constraints are
