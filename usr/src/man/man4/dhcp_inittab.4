.SH NAME
dhcp_inittab \- information repository for DHCP options
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fB/etc/dhcp/inittab\fR and the \fB/etc/dhcp/inittab6\fR files contain
information about the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (\fBDHCP\fR) options,
which are network configuration parameters passed from \fBDHCP\fR servers to
\fBDHCP\fR clients when a client machine uses \fBDHCP\fR. Since many
\fBDHCP\fR-related commands must parse and understand these \fBDHCP\fR options,
this file serves as a central location where information about these options
may be obtained.
.sp
.LP
The \fBDHCP\fR \fBinittab\fR and \fBinittab6\fR files provide three general
pieces of information:
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
A mnemonic alias, or symbol name, for each option number. For instance, option
12 is aliased to the name \fBHostname\fR. This is useful for \fBDHCP\fR-related
programs that require human interaction, such as \fBdhcpinfo\fR(1).
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
Information about the syntax for each option. This includes information such as
the type of the value, for example, whether it is a 16-bit integer or an
\fBIP\fR address.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
The policy for what options are visible to which \fBDHCP\fR-related programs.
.RE
.sp
.LP
If you make any changes to the \fB/etc/dhcp/inittab\fR file, note that only
additions of or changes to \fBSITE\fR options are preserved during upgrade. For
\fB/etc/dhcp/inittab6\fR, no options are preserved during upgrade.
.sp
.LP
The \fBVENDOR\fR options defined here are intended for use by the Solaris
\fBDHCP\fR client and \fBDHCP\fR management tools. The \fBSUNW\fR vendor space
is owned by Sun, and changes are likely during upgrade. If you need to
configure the Solaris \fBDHCP\fR server to support the vendor options of a
different client, see \fBdhcptab\fR(4) for details.
.sp
.LP
Each \fBDHCP\fR option belongs to a certain category, which roughly defines the
scope of the option; for instance, an option may only be understood by certain
hosts within a given site, or it may be globally understood by all \fBDHCP\fR
clients and servers. The following categories are defined; the category names
are not case-sensitive:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBSTANDARD\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 12n
All client and server \fBDHCP\fR implementations agree on the semantics. These
are administered by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (\fBIANA\fR). These
options are numbered from \fB1\fR to \fB127\fR for IPv4 DHCP, and \fB1\fR to
\fB65535\fR for DHCPv6.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBSITE\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 12n
Within a specific site, all client and server implementations agree on the
semantics. However, at another site the type and meaning of the option may be
quite different. These options are numbered from \fB128\fR to \fB254\fR for
IPv4 DHCP. DHCPv6 does not support site options.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBVENDOR\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 12n
Each vendor may define \fB254\fR options (65536 for DHCPv6) unique to that
vendor. The vendor is identified within a \fBDHCP\fR packet by the "Vendor
Class" option, number \fB60\fR (number \fB17\fR for DHCPv6). An option with a
specific numeric identifier belonging to one vendor will, in general, have a
type and semantics different from that of a different vendor. Vendor options
are "super-encapsulated" into the vendor field number \fB43\fR, as defined in
\fIRFC 2132\fR for IPv4 DHCP, and number \fB17\fR as defined in RFC 3315 for
DHCPv6. The \fB/etc/dhcp/inittab\fR file contains only Sun vendor options.
Define non-Sun vendor options in the \fBdhcptab\fR file.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBFIELD\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 12n
This category allows the fixed fields within a \fBDHCP\fR packet to be aliased
to a mnemonic name for use with \fBdhcpinfo\fR(1).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBINTERNAL\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 12n
This category is internal to the Solaris \fBDHCP\fR implementation and will not
be further defined.
.RE

.SS "DHCP \fBinittab\fR and \fBinittab6\fR Format"
.sp
.LP
Data entries are written one per line and have seven fields; each entry
provides information for one option. Each field is separated by a comma, except
for the first and second, which are separated by whitespace (as defined in
\fBisspace\fR(3C)). An entry cannot be continued onto another line. Blank lines
and those whose first non-whitespace character is '#' are ignored.
.sp
.LP
The fields, in order, are:
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
Mnemonic Identifier
.sp
The Mnemonic Identifier is a user-friendly alias for the option number; it is
not case sensitive. This field must be per-category unique and should be unique
across all categories. The option names in the \fBSTANDARD\fR, \fBSITE\fR, and
\fBVENDOR\fR spaces should not overlap, or the behavior will be undefined. See
\fBMnemonic Identifiers for Options\fR section of this man page for
descriptions of the option names.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
Category (scope)
.sp
The Category field is one of \fBSTANDARD\fR, \fBSITE\fR, \fBVENDOR\fR,
\fBFIELD\fR, or \fBINTERNAL\fR and identifies the scope in which the option
falls. \fBSITE\fR is not used in \fBinittab6\fR.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
Option Number
.sp
The Option Number is the number of this option when it is in a \fBDHCP\fR
packet. This field should be per-category unique and the \fBSTANDARD\fR and
\fBSITE\fR fields should not have overlapping code fields or the behavior is
undefined.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o

.sp
Data Type is one of the following values, which are not case sensitive:
.RS

The data type field describes an indivisible unit of the option payload, using
one of the values listed above.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
Granularity
.sp
The Granularity field describes how many indivisible units in the option
payload make up a whole value or item for this option. The value must be
greater than zero (\fB0\fR) for any data type other than Bool, in which case it
must be zero (\fB0\fR).
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
Maximum Number Of Items
.sp
This value specifies the maximum items of  Granularity which  are permissible
in a definition using this symbol. For example, there can only  be  one  IP
address specified for a subnet mask, so the  Maximum number of            items
in this case is one (\fB1\fR).  A   Maximum  value  of zero (\fB0\fR) means
that a variable number of items is permitted.
.RE
.RS +4

The Visibility field specifies which \fBDHCP\fR-related programs make use of
this information, and should always be defined as \fBsdmi\fR for newly added
options.
