.SH SYNOPSIS

.nf
\fB/etc/remote\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The systems known by \fBtip\fR(1) and their attributes are stored in an
\fBASCII\fR file which is structured somewhat like the \fBtermcap\fR file. Each
line in the file provides a description for a single \fIsystem\fR. Fields are
separated by a colon `\fB:\fR'. Lines ending in a `\fB\e\fR\&' character with
an immediately following \fBNEWLINE\fR are continued on the next line.
.sp
.LP
The first entry is the name(s) of the host system. If there is more than one
name for a system, the names are separated by vertical bars. After the name of
the system comes the fields of the description.  A field name followed by an
`\fB=\fR' sign indicates a string value follows. A field name followed by a
`\fB#\fR' sign indicates a following numeric value.
.sp
.LP
Entries named \fBtip\fR\fIbaudrate\fR are used as default entries by \fBtip\fR,
as follows.  When \fBtip\fR is invoked with only a phone number, it looks for
an entry of the form \fBtip\fR\fIbaudrate\fR, where \fIbaudrate\fR is the baud
rate with which the connection is to be made.  For example, if the connection
is to be made at  \fB300\fR baud, \fBtip\fR looks for an entry of the form
\fBtip300\fR.
.SH CAPABILITIES
.sp
.LP
Capabilities are either strings \fB(str)\fR, numbers \fB(num)\fR, or boolean
flags \fB(bool)\fR. A string capability is specified by
\fIcapability\fR=\fIvalue\fR; for example, `\fBdv=/dev/harris\fR'. A numeric
capability is specified by \fIcapability\fR#\fIvalue\fR; for example,
`\fBxa#99\fR'. A boolean capability is specified by simply listing the
capability.

\fB\fBpn\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
\fB(str)\fR Telephone number(s) for this host. If the telephone number field
contains an `\fB@\fR' sign, \fBtip\fR searches the \fB/etc/phones\fR file for a
list of telephone numbers \(em see \fBphones\fR(4). A `\fB%\fR' sign in the
telephone number indicates a 5-second delay for the Ventel Modem.
.sp
For Hayes-compatible modems, if the telephone number starts with an 'S', the
telephone number string will be sent to the modem without the "\fBDT\fR", which
allows reconfiguration of the modem's S-registers and other parameters; for
example, to disable auto-answer:  "\fBpn=S0=0DT5551234\fR";  or to also
restrict the modem to return only the basic result codes:
"\fBpn=S0=0X0DT5551234\fR".
