.Dt MAILER.CONF 4
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm mailer.conf
.Nd configuration file for
.Xr mailwrapper 1M
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The file
.Pa /etc/mailer.conf
contains a series of lines of the form
.Pp
.Ar name
.Ar program
.Op Ar arguments ...
.Pp
The first word of each line is the
.Ar name
of a program invoking
.Xr mailwrapper 1M .
(For example, on a typical system
.Pa /usr/lib/sendmail
would be a symbolic link to
.Xr mailwrapper 1M ,
as would
.Xr newaliases 1M
and
.Xr mailq 1 .
Thus,
.Ar name
might be
.Dq Li sendmail
or
.Dq Li newaliases
etc.)
.Pp
The second word of each line is the name of the
.Ar program
to actually execute when the first name is invoked.
.Pp
The further
.Ar arguments ,
if any, are passed to the
.Ar program ,
followed by the arguments
.Xr mailwrapper 1M
was called with.
.Pp
The file may also contain comment lines, denoted by a
.Ql #
mark in the first column of any line.
.Sh FILES
/etc/mail/mailer.conf
.Sh EXAMPLES
This example shows how to set up
.Nm
to invoke the traditional
.Xr sendmail 1M
program:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# Execute the "real" sendmail program located in
# /usr/lib/smtp/sendmail/sendmail
sendmail	/usr/lib/smtp/sendmail/sendmail
mailq		/usr/lib/smtp/sendmail/sendmail
newaliases	/usr/lib/smtp/sendmail/sendmail
