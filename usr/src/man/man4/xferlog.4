\fB/var/log/xferlog\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBxferlog\fR file contains transfer logging information from the FTP
Server, \fBin.ftpd\fR(1M). You can use the logfile capability to change the
location of the log file. See \fBftpaccess\fR(4).
.sp
.LP
By default, each server entry is composed of a single line of the following
form. All fields are separated by spaces.
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fIcurrent-time\fR  \fItransfer-time \fR   \fIremote-host\fR  \fIbytes-transferred\fR  \e

The \fBxferlog\fR format capability can be used to customize the transfer log
file format used. In addition to those in the default format, it also supports
\fBchroot-filename\fR, \fBfile-size\fR, and \fBrestart-offset\fR fields. See
\fBftpaccess\fR(4).
