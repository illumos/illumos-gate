.TH DHCPSVC.CONF 4 "Jun 26, 2003"
.SH NAME
dhcpsvc.conf \- file containing service configuration parameters for the DHCP
service
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBdhcpsvc.conf\fR file resides in directory \fB/etc/inet\fR and contains
parameters for specifying Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (\fBDHCP\fR)
service configuration settings, including the type and location of \fBDHCP\fR
data store used.
.sp
.LP
The description of the \fBdhcpsvc.conf\fR file in this man page is
informational only. The preferred method of setting or modifying values within
the \fBdhcpsvc.conf\fR file is by using \fBdhcpconfig\fR(1M) or the
\fBdhcpmgr\fR(1M) utility. Do not edit the \fBdhcpsvc.conf\fR file.
.sp
.LP
The \fBdhcpsvc.conf\fR file format is \fBASCII\fR; comment lines begin with the
crosshatch (\fB#\fR) character. Parameters consist of a keyword followed by an
equals (\fB=\fR) sign followed by the parameter value, of the form:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fIKeyword\fR=\fIValue\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
The following \fIKeyword\fR and \fIValue\fR parameters are supported:
.sp
.ne 2

String. \fBautomatic\fR or \fBmanual\fR. Enables support of \fBBOOTP\fR
clients. Default is no \fBBOOTP\fR. Value selects \fBBOOTP\fR address
allocation method. \fBautomatic\fR to support all BOOTP clients, \fBmanual\fR

parameter.

.ne 2
.na
\fBDAEMON_ENABLED\fR
.ad
.RS 28n

.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fBHOSTS_DOMAIN\fR
.ad
.RS 28n
String. Defines name service domain that DHCP administration tools use when
managing the hosts table. Valid only when \fBHOSTS_RESOURCE\fR is set to
\fBnisplus\fR or \fBdns\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fBHOSTS_RESOURCE\fR
.ad
.RS 28n
String. Defines what name service resource should be used by the DHCP
administration tools when managing the hosts table. Current valid values are
\fBfiles\fR, \fBnisplus\fR, and \fBdns\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fBICMP_VERIFY\fR
.ad
.RS 28n
\fBTRUE\fR/\fBFALSE\fR. Toggles \fBICMP\fR echo verification of IP addresses.
Default is \fBTRUE\fR. \fBserver\fR mode only parameter.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fBINTERFACES\fR
.ad
.RS 28n
String. Comma-separated list of interface names to listen to. Generic
parameter.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fBLOGGING_FACILITY\fR
.ad
.RS 28n
Integer. Local facility number (\fB0\fR-\fB7\fR inclusive) to log \fBDHCP\fR
events to. Default is not to log transactions. Generic parameter.
.RE

.sp

.na
\fBOFFER_CACHE_TIMEOUT\fR
.ad
.RS 28n
Integer. Number of seconds before \fBOFFER\fR cache timeouts occur. Default is
\fB10\fR seconds. \fBserver\fR mode only parameter.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fBOWNER_IP\fR
.ad
.RS 28n
String. List of supplemental ownership addresses  that will be used by the DHCP
server in determining the \fBdhcp_network\fR records that are under its
management. Addresses are in the dotted Internet form of an IPv4 address.
Primary value is the IP address associated with the system's primary interface
(\fInodename\fR == \fIhostname\fR). Server-mode-only parameter. Note that using
\fBOWNER_IP\fR has some performance impact, thus using a large number might not
be advisable.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fBPATH\fR
.ad
.RS 28n
Path to DHCP data tables within the data store specified by the RESOURCE
parameter. The value of the \fBPATH\fR keyword is specific to the RESOURCE.

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fBRELAY_DESTINATIONS\fR

\fBPATH\fR keyword in \fBdhcp_modules\fR(5).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fBRESOURCE_CONFIG\fR
.ad
.RS 28n
String. The private layer provides for module-specific configuration
information through the use of the \fBRESOURCE_CONFIG\fR keyword. See
\fBdhcp_modules\fR(5).
.sp
Providers can access \fBRESOURCE_CONFIG\fR using the configure function by
specifying an optional service provider layer API function:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
int configure(const char *configp);
.fi
.in -2

If this function is defined by the public module provider, it is called during
module load time by the private layer, with the contents of the
\fBRESOURCE_CONFIG\fR string acquired by the administrative interface (in the
case of the \fBdhcpmgr\fR, through the use of a public module-specific java
bean extending the \fBdhcpmgr\fR to provide a configuration dialog for this
information.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fBRUN_MODE\fR
.ad
.RS 28n
\fBserver\fR or \fBrelay\fR. Selects daemon run mode. Default is \fBserver\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fBSECONDARY_SERVER_TIMEOUT\fR
.ad
.RS 28n
Integer. The number of seconds a secondary server waits for a primary server to
respond before responding itself. Default is \fB20\fR seconds. This is a server
mode only parameter.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fBUPDATE_TIMEOUT\fR
.ad
.RS 28n
Integer. Number of seconds to wait for a response from the DNS server before
timing out. If this parameter is present, the DHCP daemon updates DNS on behalf
of DHCP clients, and waits the number of seconds specified for a response
before timing out. You can use \fBUPDATE_TIMEOUT\fR without specifying a number
to enable DNS updates with the default timeout of 15 seconds. If this parameter
is not present, the DHCP daemon does not update DNS for DHCP clients.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fBVERBOSE\fR
.ad
.RS 28n
\fBTRUE\fR/\fBFALSE\fR. Toggles verbose mode, determining amount of status and
error messages reported by the daemon. Default is \fBFALSE\fR. Set to
\fBTRUE\fR only for debugging. Generic parameter.
