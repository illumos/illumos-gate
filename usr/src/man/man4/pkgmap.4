.SH NAME
pkgmap \- package contents description file
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBpkgmap\fR is an \fBASCII\fR file that provides a complete listing of the
package contents. It is automatically generated by \fBpkgmk\fR(1) using the
information in the \fBprototype\fR(4) file.
.sp
.LP
Each entry in \fBpkgmap\fR describes a single ``deliverable object file.'' A
deliverable object file includes shell scripts, executable objects, data files,
directories, and so forth. The entry consists of several fields of information,
each field separated by a space. The fields are described below and must appear
in the order shown.
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fIpart\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 12n
An optional field designating the part number in which the object resides. A
part is a collection of files and is the atomic unit by which a package is
processed. A developer can choose the criteria for grouping files into a part
(for example, based on class). If no value is defined in this field, part 1 is
assumed.

\fB\fIftype\fR\fR

those that are modifiable.

information file (such as a file containing a copyright, list of dependencies,

be modified.

Files of the following types can be modified:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBe\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 5n
An editable file, intended to be edited (selectively modified) after
installation. An editable file is expected to change on installation or
removal, can be shared by several packages, and must be installed by a class
action script. Examples are a configuration file or a list of users.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBv\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 5n
A volatile file, intended to be overwritten or appended to after installation.
A volatile file is not expected to change on installation or removal, is not
preserved between installations, and can be installed by a class action script.
Examples are a log file or a lock file.
.RE

Following package installation, the contents of files of all types except
\fBe\fR and \fBv\fR must not change. Any file that is subject to change should
be marked as \fBe\fR or \fBv\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fIclass\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 12n
The installation class to which the file belongs. This name must contain only
alphanumeric characters and be no longer than 12 characters. It is not
specified if the \fIftype\fR is \fBi\fR (information file).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fIpathname\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 12n
\fIpathname\fR may contain variables of the form \fB$\fR\fIvariable\fR that
support install-time configuration of the file. \fIvariable\fR may be embedded
in the pathname structure. (See \fBprototype\fR(4) for definitions of variable
specifications.)
.sp
Do not use the following reserved words in \fIpathname\fR, since they are
applied by \fBpkgadd\fR(1M) using a different mechanism:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
PKG_INSTALL_ROOT
BASEDIR
CLIENT_BASEDIR

.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fImajor\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 12n
The major device number. The field is only specified for block or character
special devices.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fIminor\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 12n
The minor device number. The field is only specified for block or character
special devices.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fImode\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 12n
The octal mode of the file (for example, 0664). A question mark (\fB?\fR)
indicates that the mode will be left unchanged, implying that the file already
exists on the target machine. This field is not used for linked files,
packaging information files, or non-installable files.
.sp
The mode can contain a variable specification. (See \fBprototype\fR(4) for
definitions of variable specifications.)
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fIowner\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 12n
The owner of the file (for example, \fBbin\fR or \fBroot\fR). The field is
limited to 14 characters in length. A question mark (\fB?\fR) indicates that
the owner will be left unchanged or changed to the owner stored in the package
database, which could be different from what is on the file system. When the
question mark is used, it implies that the file is already on the file system.
This field is not used for linked files or non-installable files. It is used
optionally with a package information file. If used, it indicates with what
owner an installation script will be executed.
.sp
The owner can contain a variable specification. (See \fBprototype\fR(4) for
definitions of variable specifications.)
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fIgroup\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 12n
The group to which the file belongs (for example, \fBbin\fR or \fBsys\fR). The
field is limited to 14 characters in length. A question mark (\fB?\fR)
indicates that the group will be left unchanged or changed to the owner stored
in the package database, which could be different from what is on the file
system. When the question mark is used, it implies that the file is already on
the file system. This field is not used for linked files or non-installable
files. It is used optionally with a package information file. If used, it
indicates with what group an installation script will be executed.
.sp
The group can contain a variable specification. (See \fBprototype\fR(4) for
definitions of variable specifications.)
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fIsize\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 12n
The actual size of the file in bytes. This field is not specified for named
pipes, special devices, directories or linked files.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fIcksum\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 12n
The checksum of the file contents. This field is not specified for named pipes,
special devices, directories, or linked files.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fImodtime\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 12n
The time of last modification, as reported by the \fBstat\fR(2) function call.
This field is not specified for named pipes, special devices, directories, or
linked files.
.RE

.sp
.LP
Each \fBpkgmap\fR file must have one line that provides information about the
number of parts, maximum size of parts that make up the package, and,
optionally, the size of the package after compression (where size is given in
512-byte blocks). This line is in the following format:
.sp
.LP
\fB:\fR \fInumber_of_parts\fR \fImaximum_part_size\fR \fIcompressed_pkg_size\fR
.sp
.LP
Lines that begin with ``\fB#\fR'' are comment lines and are ignored.
.sp
.LP
When files are saved during installation before they are overwritten, they are
normally just copied to a temporary pathname. However, for files whose mode
includes execute permission (but which are not editable), the existing version
is linked to a temporary pathname and the original file is removed. This allows
processes which are executing during installation to be overwritten.
