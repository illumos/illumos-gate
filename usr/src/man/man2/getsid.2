.TH GETSID 2 "Jan 22, 1996"
.SH NAME
getsid \- get process group ID of session leader
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <unistd.h>

\fBpid_t\fR \fBgetsid\fR(\fBpid_t\fR \fIpid\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBgetsid()\fR function obtains the process group \fBID\fR of the process
that is the session leader of the process specified by \fIpid\fR.  If \fIpid\fR
is \fB(pid_t)\|0\fR, it specifies the calling process.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fBgetsid()\fR returns the process group \fBID\fR
of the session leader of the specified process. Otherwise, it returns
\fB(pid_t)\(mi1\fR and sets \fBerrno\fR to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The \fBgetsid()\fR function will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBEPERM\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 9n
The process specified by \fIpid\fR is not in the same session as the calling
process, and the implementation does not allow access to the process group
\fBID\fR of the session leader of that process from the calling process.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBESRCH\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 9n
There is no process with a process \fBID\fR equal to \fIpid\fR.
