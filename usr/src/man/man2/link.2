.SH NAME
link \- link to a file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <unistd.h>

\fBint\fR \fBlink\fR(\fBconst char *\fR\fIexisting\fR, \fBconst char *\fR\fInew\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBlink()\fR function creates a new link (directory entry) for the existing
file and increments its link count by one.  The \fIexisting\fR argument points
to a path name naming an existing file.  The \fInew\fR argument points to a
pathname naming the new directory entry to be created.
.sp
.LP
To create hard links, both files must be on the same file system. Both the old
and the new link share equal access and rights to the underlying object.
Privileged processes can make multiple links to a directory. Unless the caller
is privileged, the file named by \fIexisting\fR must not be a directory.
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fBlink()\fR marks for update the \fBst_ctime\fR
field of the file. Also, the \fBst_ctime\fR and \fBst_mtime\fR fields of the
directory that contains the new entry are marked for update.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fB0\fR is returned. Otherwise, \fB\(mi1\fR is
returned, no link is created, and \fBerrno\fR is set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The \fBlink()\fR function will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBEACCES\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
A component of either path prefix denies search permission, or the requested
link requires writing in a directory with a mode that denies write permission.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBEDQUOT\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
The directory where the entry for the new link is being placed cannot be
extended because the user's quota of disk blocks on that file system has been
exhausted.

.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBEILSEQ\fR\fR

.na
\fB\fBENAMETOOLONG\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
The length of the \fIexisting\fR or \fInew\fR argument exceeds \fBPATH_MAX\fR,

while \fB_POSIX_NO_TRUNC\fR is in effect.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBENOENT\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
The \fIexisting\fR or \fInew\fR argument is a null pathname; a component of

exist.
.RE

\fB\fBEPERM\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
The file named by \fIexisting\fR is a directory and the
