.SH NAME
btowc, btowc_l \- single-byte to wide-character conversion
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <stdio.h>
#include <wchar.h>

\fBwint_t\fR \fBbtowc\fR(\fBint\fR \fIc\fR);
.fi
.LP
.nf
#include <stdio.h>
#include <wchar.h>
#include <xlocale.h>

\fBwint_t\fR \fBbtowc_l\fR(\fBint\fR \fIc\fR, \fBlocale_t\fR \fIloc\fR);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fBbtowc()\fR and \fBbtowc_l\fR()functions determines whether
\fIc\fR constitutes a valid (one-byte) character in the initial shift
state.
.LP
The behavior of \fBbtowc()\fR is affected by the \fBLC_CTYPE\fR category of the
current locale.  See \fBenviron\fR(5). The function \fBbtowc_l()\fR does
not use the current locale, and instead operates on the locale
specified by \fIloc\fR.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.LP
The \fBbtowc()\fR function returns \fBWEOF\fR if \fIc\fR has the value
\fBEOF\fR or if  \fB(unsigned char)\fR\fIc\fR does not constitute a valid
(one-byte) character in the initial shift state.  Otherwise, it returns the
wide-character representation of that character.
.SH ERRORS
.LP
No errors are defined.
