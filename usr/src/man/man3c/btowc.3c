.SH NAME
btowc \- single-byte to wide-character conversion
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <stdio.h>
#include <wchar.h>

\fBwint_t\fR \fBbtowc\fR(\fBint\fR \fIc\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBbtowc()\fR function determines whether \fIc\fR constitutes a valid
(one-byte) character in the initial shift state.
.sp
.LP
The behavior of this function is affected by the \fBLC_CTYPE\fR category of the
current locale.  See \fBenviron\fR(5).
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
The \fBbtowc()\fR function returns \fBWEOF\fR if \fIc\fR has the value
\fBEOF\fR or if  \fB(unsigned char)\fR\fIc\fR does not constitute a valid
(one-byte) character in the initial shift state.  Otherwise, it returns the
wide-character representation of that character.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
No errors are defined.
.SH ATTRIBUTES

.LP
The \fBbtowc()\fR function can be used safely in multithreaded applications, as
long as \fBsetlocale\fR(3C) is not being called to change the locale.
