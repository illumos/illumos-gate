.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The functions \fBpthread_attr_setschedparam()\fR and
\fBpthread_attr_getschedparam()\fR, respectively, set and get the scheduling
parameter attributes in the \fIattr\fR argument. The contents of the
\fIparam\fR structure are defined in \fB<sched.h>\fR\&. The only required
member of \fIparam\fR is \fIsched_priority\fR.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
If successful, the \fBpthread_attr_setschedparam()\fR and
\fBpthread_attr_getschedparam()\fR functions return  \fB0\fR. Otherwise, an
error number is returned to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
