.SH NAME
dup2 \- duplicate an open file descriptor
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <unistd.h>

\fBint\fR \fBdup2\fR(\fBint\fR \fIfildes\fR, \fBint\fR \fIfildes2\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBdup2()\fR function causes the file descriptor \fIfildes2\fR to refer to
the same file as \fIfildes\fR. The \fIfildes\fR argument is a file descriptor
referring to an open file, and \fIfildes2\fR is a non-negative integer less
than the current value for the maximum number of open file descriptors  allowed
the calling process.  See \fBgetrlimit\fR(2). If \fIfildes2\fR already refers
to an open file, not \fIfildes\fR, it is closed first. If \fIfildes2\fR refers
to \fIfildes\fR, or if \fIfildes\fR is not a valid open file descriptor,
\fIfildes2\fR will not be closed first.
.sp
.LP
The \fBdup2()\fR function is equivalent to  \fBfcntl\fR(\fIfildes\fR,
\fBF_DUP2FD\fR, \fIfildes2\fR).
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion a non-negative integer representing the file
descriptor is returned. Otherwise, \fB\(mi1\fR is returned and \fBerrno\fR is
set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The \fBdup2()\fR function will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBEBADF\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
The \fIfildes\fR argument is not a valid open file descriptor.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBEBADF\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
The \fIfildes2\fR argument is negative or is not less than the current resource
limit returned by \fBgetrlimit(RLIMIT_NOFILE, .\|.\|.)\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBEINTR\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
A signal was caught during the \fBdup2()\fR call.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBEMFILE\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
The process has too many open files.  See  \fBfcntl\fR(2).
