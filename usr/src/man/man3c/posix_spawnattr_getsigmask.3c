.TH POSIX_SPAWNATTR_GETSIGMASK 3C "Jan 30, 2004"
.SH NAME
posix_spawnattr_getsigmask, posix_spawnattr_setsigmask \- get and set
spawn-sigmask attribute of spawn attributes object
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <signal.h>
#include <spawn.h>

\fBint\fR \fBposix_spawnattr_getsigmask\fR(\fBconst posix_spawnattr_t *restrict\fR \fIattr\fR,
     \fBsigset_t *restrict\fR \fIsigmask\fR);
.fi

.LP
.nf
\fBint\fR \fBposix_spawnattr_setsigmask\fR(\fBposix_spawnattr_t *restrict\fR \fIattr\fR,
     \fBconst sigset_t *restrict\fR \fIsigmask\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBposix_spawnattr_getsigmask()\fR function obtains the value of the
\fIspawn-sigmask\fR attribute from the attributes object referenced by
\fIattr\fR.
.sp
.LP
The \fBposix_spawnattr_setsigmask()\fR function sets the \fIspawn-sigmask\fR
attribute in an initialized attributes object referenced by \fIattr\fR.
.sp
.LP
The \fIspawn-sigmask\fR attribute represents the signal mask in effect in the
new process image of a spawn operation (if \fBPOSIX_SPAWN_SETSIGMASK\fR is set
in the\fI spawn-flags\fR attribute). The default value of this attribute is
unspecified.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fBposix_spawnattr_getsigmask()\fR returns 0 and
stores the value of the \fIspawn-sigmask\fR attribute of \fIattr\fR into the
object referenced by the \fIsigmask\fR parameter.  Otherwise, an error number
is returned to indicate the error.
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fBposix_spawnattr_setsigmask()\fR returns 0.
Otherwise, an error number is returned to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
