.SH NAME
wctob \- wide-character to single-byte conversion
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <stdio.h>
#include <wchar.h>

\fBint\fR \fBwctob\fR(\fBwint_t\fR \fIc\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBwctob()\fR function determines whether \fIc\fR corresponds to a member
of the extended character set whose  character representation is a single byte
when in the initial shift state.
.sp
.LP
The behavior of this function is affected by the \fBLC_CTYPE\fR category of the
current locale.  See \fBenviron\fR(5)
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
The \fBwctob()\fR function returns \fBEOF\fR if \fIc\fR does not correspond to
a character with length one in the initial shift state.  Otherwise, it returns
the single-byte representation of that character.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
No errors are defined.
.SH ATTRIBUTES

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
The \fBwctob()\fR function can be used safely in multithreaded applications, as
long as \fBsetlocale\fR(3C) is not being called to change the locale.
