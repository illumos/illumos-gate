.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBsdp_delete_all_field()\fR function deletes all the occurrences of the
specified SDP field from the session structure. For example, if the session
structure has 3 bandwidth (b=) fields, then when this function is called with
\fBSDP_BANDWIDTH_FIELD\fR, all the three bandwidth fields are deleted from the
session structure.
.sp
.LP
The \fBsdp_delete_all_media_field()\fR function deletes all the occurrences of
the specified SDP field from the specified media structure. For example, if the
caller wants to delete all the attribute fields in a media structure, calling
this function with \fBSDP_ATTRIBUTE_FIELD\fR argument would delete all the
attribute fields in the media structure.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, these functions return 0. Otherwise, the
appropriate error value is returned. The value of \fBerrno\fR is not changed by
these calls in the event of an error.

.LP
These functions will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEINVAL\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
The \fIsession\fR or \fImedia\fR argument is \fINULL\fR or the field type is
unknown.
