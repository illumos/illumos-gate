# This script is invoked by python-governed executable wrappers from within
# s10-branded zones.  It uses the native python and native linker.
# The only consumer is currently the zfs command which uses python for
# a few of its subcommands.
#
# All native executables must be run using the native linker.
# By default, the kernel loads the linker at /lib/ld.so.1, which
# in an s10 zone is the s10 linker.  Hence when we run the native
# executable below, we explicitly specify /.SUNWnative/lib/ld.so.1 as our 32-
# bit linker and /.SUNWnative/lib/64/ld.so.1 as our 64-bit linker.
# For convience we define "n" to be the native path prefix.
