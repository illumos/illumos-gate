The Linux Test Project (LTP) provides the basis for testing the lx API
implementation. The project webpage is at http://linux-test-project.github.io/
and the source is available on GitHub at
https://github.com/linux-test-project/ltp.git.

LTP should be built and run from within an lx zone.

To build
--------
As root first make sure you have the tools installed:
    apt-get install build-essential autoconf automake git quota

As a normal user:
    git clone https://github.com/linux-test-project/ltp.git
    cd ltp
    make autotools
    ./configure
    make all

As root:
    make install

The tests can be built in both a zone that has been installed with a 32-bit
version of Linux and another zone that has been installed with a 64-bit version
of the same release. When testing the 64-bit zone, a copy of the 32-bit build
can be run in the 64-bit zone to ensure that 32-bit applications work
correctly on a 64-bit install.

Running the tests
-----------------
The LTP source tree provides detailed documentation on using the test suite, so
this readme only give a short summary.

Because many of the tests are targetted at kernel functionality which does not
apply to Illumos, or test capabilities which are not available from within a
zone, or test system call functionality which has not yet been completed, a
skip list is used during the test run to bypass tests which are known to fail.

The skip list lives in this directory and is delivered on the system. It is
available from within the lx zone as /native/usr/lib/brand/lx/ltp_skiplist. As
new functionality is completed, the skip list should be updated to remove tests
which now work.

As root:
    cd /opt/ltp
    /opt/ltp/runltp -f `cat /native/usr/lib/brand/lx/ltp_tests` \
        -S /native/usr/lib/brand/lx/ltp_skiplist -p >/tmp/test.log

When the test run has finished, the results will be logged in a date/time
stamped file under /opt/ltp/results. The summary at the end of the log file
should show "Total Failures: 0". If not, something is wrong.

Running tests for development
-----------------------------
The source for the tests can be found under the testcases directory. The
largest and most useful set for lx live under testcases/kernel/syscalls. 

For development purposes, an individual test (or tests) can be run by listing
them in a command file, one per line. For example, with a command file named
~/tcmds, to run the read01 test you setup the file so it looks like this:
    read01 read01

You can run that specific test as follows:
    /opt/ltp/runltp -f ~/tcmds -p -l ~/read.log

Test status
-----------
This section provides a short summary of the rationale for why tests are being
skipped.

LTP groups tests into command files (i.e. syscalls, nptl, etc. provided with
the -f option in the runltp command shown above). A complete list of the groups
can be seen in LTP source tree under the runtest directory. Some of these
groups are obviously not applicable when running in an lx zone. The remaining
groups still need work before they can be run. The groups shown in the runltp
command above are expected to work when the skip list is used. The 'syscalls'
command file runs the majority of the actual system call tests which we are
interested in.

The following table indicates why specific subtests are being skipped. Also
note that the following tests pass in a 64-bit lx zone, but fail in a zone
installed with a 32-bit Linux build: mmap15, open12, openat02 and sendfile09.

    Legend:
	x = never in a zone
	* = fails on kvm and bare metal too
	# = emulation not implemented yet
	- = could enable with a test zone config change
