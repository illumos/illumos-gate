/*
 * WARNING!
 *	  Do NOT add entries to this list such that it grows the list
 *	  beyond the last entry:
 *		151	Stale NFS file handle
 *	  Growing this list may damage programs because this array is
 *	  copied into a reserved array at runtime.  See bug 4097669.
 *
 *	  If you need to add an entry please use one of the empty
 *	  slots.
 *	  The arrays _sys_errs[], accessible via perror(3C) and strerror(3C)
 *	  interfaces, and sys_errlist[] are created from this list.
 *	  It is the direct referencing of sys_errlist[] that is the problem.
 *	  Your code should only use perror() or strerror().
 *
 *	  The table is organized with the first column being the error number.
 *	  The second column is the error's name. If the error should be skipped
 *	  from the list, it has the magic name 'SKIP'. This generally is for
 *	  the XENIX errors. The third column to the end of the file is the
 *	  string that shows up when you run strerror().
