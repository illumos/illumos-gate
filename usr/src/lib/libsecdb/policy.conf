# crypt(3c) Algorithms Configuration
#
# CRYPT_ALGORITHMS_ALLOW specifies the algorithms that are allowed to
# be used for new passwords.  This is enforced only in crypt_gensalt(3c).
#
CRYPT_ALGORITHMS_ALLOW=1,2a,md5

# To deprecate use of the traditional unix algorithm, uncomment below
# and change CRYPT_DEFAULT= to another algorithm.  For example,
# CRYPT_DEFAULT=1 for BSD/Linux MD5.
#
#CRYPT_ALGORITHMS_DEPRECATE=__unix__

# The Solaris default is the traditional UNIX algorithm.  This is not
# listed in crypt.conf(4) since it is internal to libc.  The reserved
# name __unix__ is used to refer to it.
#
CRYPT_DEFAULT=__unix__
#
# These settings determine the default privileges users have.  If not set,
# the default privileges are taken from the inherited set.
# There are two different settings; PRIV_DEFAULT determines the default
# set on login; PRIV_LIMIT defines the Limit set on login.
# Individual users can have privileges assigned or taken away through
# user_attr.  Privileges can also be assigned to profiles in which case
# the users with those profiles can use those privileges through pfexec(1m).
# For maximum future compatibility, the specifications should
# always include "basic" or "all"; privileges should then be removed using
# the negation.  E.g., PRIV_LIMIT=all,!sys_linkdir takes away only the
# sys_linkdir privilege, regardless of future additional privileges.
# Similarly, PRIV_DEFAULT=basic,!file_link_any takes away only the
# file_link_any privilege from the basic privilege set; only that notation
# is immune from a future addition of currently unprivileged operations to
# the basic privilege set.
# NOTE: removing privileges from the the Limit set requires EXTREME care
# as any set-uid root program may suddenly fail because it lacks certain
# privilege(s).
#
#PRIV_DEFAULT=basic
#PRIV_LIMIT=all
#
# LOCK_AFTER_RETRIES specifies the default account locking policy for local
# user accounts (passwd(4)/shadow(4)).  The default may be overridden by
# a user's user_attr(4) "lock_after_retries" value.
# YES enables local account locking, NO disables local account locking.
# The default value is NO.
#
#LOCK_AFTER_RETRIES=NO
