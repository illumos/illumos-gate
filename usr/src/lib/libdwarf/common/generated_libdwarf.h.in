    $Revision: #9 $ $Date: 2008/01/17 $

    For libdwarf producers and consumers

    The interface is defined as having 8-byte signed and unsigned
    values so it can handle 64-or-32bit target on 64-or-32bit host.
    Dwarf_Ptr is the native size: it represents pointers on
    the host machine (not the target!).

    This contains declarations for types and all producer
    and consumer functions.

    Function declarations are written on a single line each here
    so one can use grep  to each declaration in its entirety.
    The declarations are a little harder to read this way, but...

    The seeming duplication of the Elf typedef allows
    both verification we have the right struct name (when
    libelf.h included before this) and
    creation of a local handle so we have the struct pointer
    here (if libelf.h is not included before this file).

/* Begin libdwarf Object File Interface declarations.

As of February 2008 there are multiple dwarf_reader object access
initialization methods available:
The traditional dwarf_elf_init() and dwarf_init()  and dwarf_finish()
    which assume libelf and POSIX file access.
An object-file and library agnostic dwarf_object_init() and dwarf_object_finish()
    which allow the coder to provide object access routines
    abstracting away the elf interface.  So there is no dependence in the
    reader code on the object format and no dependence on libelf.
    See the code in dwarf_elf_access.c  and dwarf_original_elf_init.c
    to see an example of initializing the structures mentioned below.

Projects using dwarf_elf_init() or dwarf_init() can ignore
the Dwarf_Obj_Access* structures entirely as all these details
are completed for you.

As of March 2017 additional
functions dwarf_elf_init_b
and dwarf_init_b
and dwarf_object_init_b
add a groupnumber argument so DWARF5
split-dwarf sections can be accessed.
