.AL 1
.LI
Using a pair of grave accents \^\fB\(ga\fR ... \fB\(ga\fR\^
for command substition.  Use \fB$(\fR ... \fB)\fR instead.
.LI
.B FCEDIT
is an obsolete name for
the default editor name for the
.B hist
command.
.B FCEDIT
is not used when
.B HISTEDIT
is set.  Use
.B HISTEDIT
instead.
.LI
The newtest (\fB[[\fR ... \fB]]\fR) operator
\fB\-a\fP \fIfile\fP
is obsolete.  Use
\fB\-e\fP instead.
.LI
The newtest (\fB[[\fR ... \fB]]\fR) operator
.BR = ,
as used in
\fIstring\fP \fB=\fP \fIpattern\fP
is obsolete.  Use
\fB==\fP instead.
.LI
The following obsolete arithmetic comparisons are also permitted:
.in +5
.VL 20
.LI "\fIexp1\fP \fB\-eq\fP \fIexp2\fP"
True, if
.I exp1
is equal to
.IR exp2 .
.LI "\fIexp1\fP \fB\-ne\fP \fIexp2\fP"
True, if
.I exp1
is not equal to
.IR exp2 .
.LI "\fIexp1\fP \fB\-lt\fP \fIexp2\fP"
True, if
.I exp1
is less than
.IR exp2 .
.LI "\fIexp1\fP \fB\-gt\fP \fIexp2\fP"
True, if
.I exp1
is greater than
.IR exp2 .
.LI "\fIexp1\fP \fB\-le\fP \fIexp2\fP"
True, if
.I exp1
is less than or equal to
.IR exp2 .
.LI "\fIexp1\fP \fB\-ge\fP \fIexp2\fP"
True, if
.I exp1
is greater than or equal to
.IR exp2 .
.LE		\"	End .VL
.in -5
.LI
Using test -t or [ -t ] without specifying the file unit number.
.LI
The
.B \-k
option to the \fBset\fR builtin is obsolete.  It causes
.I all\^
variable assignment arguments are placed in the environment,
even if they occur after the command name.
The following
first prints
.B "a=b c"
and then
.BR c :
There is no alternative.
.LI
The obsolete
.B \-xf
option of the
.B typeset
command allows a function to be exported
to scripts that are executed without a separate
invocation of the shell.
Functions that need to be defined across separate
invocations of the shell should
be placed in a directory and the
.B FPATH
variable should contains the name of this directory.
They may also
be specified in the
.B ENV
file with the 
.B \-xf
option of
.BR typeset .
.LI
The shell environment variable
.B FCEDIT
is obsolete.  Use
.B HISTEDIT
instead.
.LI
In the
.B \-s
option
(to \fBfc\fR or \fBhist\fR command???)
(
and in obsolete versions, the editor name
.B \-
)
is used to skip the editing phase and
to re-execute the command.
.LI
The
.B \-t
option to \fBalias\fR builtin is is obsolete.  It
is used to set and list tracked aliases.
There is no replacement.
.LI
The shell command line option
.B \-t
is obsolete.  This option cause the shell to exit after reading
and executing one command.  The is no replacement (although ending
\&"command" with the exit builtin should have the same effect).
.LI
As an obsolete feature of the "set" builtin,
if the first
.I arg\^
is
.B \-
then the
.B \-x
and
.B \-v
options are turned off and the next
.I arg
is treated as the first argument.
Using
.B \+
rather than
.B \-
causes these options to be turned off.
These options can also be used upon invocation of the shell.
