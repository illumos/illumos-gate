  verify_cfg

    Identifies the program to be invoked by zonecfg to verify that the
    zone's configuration is legal, and that all the configured devices,
    attributes, etc. are legal for this brand.

    The program is called with a single argument: the path to a file
    containing a temporary config.xml file the zone.  It should return 0
    on success and non-0 on failure.  Any detailed error messages should be
    displayed to stderr.

    It has no attributes.

  boot

    This is a program which gets run by zoneadmd when a zone is booted.
    The program will be invoked as the last step in the zone booting
    process before the the first process is spawned inside the zone.

    If this programs succeeds it should not generate any output.
    If this program returns an error, any output generated by the
    program will be sent to the zoneadmd message log.

    The following replacements are performed:

      %z	Name of zone

  sysboot

    This is a program that will be run by zoneadm during system boot for an
    installed zone that won't automatically boot.

    If the program succeeds, then it should not generate output.
    If the program returns an error, then the output it generates will be
    sent to the zones SMF service's message log.

    The following replacements are performed:

  halt

    This is a program which gets run by zoneadmd when a zone is being
    halted.  This callback is provided to allow a brand to cleanup any
    special configuration that was setup during boot.

    This program will also be invoked by zoneadmd if any part of the zone
    booting process fail, even if the booting process failed before the
    brand boot program was invoked.  It is also possible that if the zone
    fails to halt after invoking this program, future attempts to halt the
    zone will invoke this program again.  So this program should be
    designed to clean up any resources allocated to a zone but it should
    also be able to gracefully handle the case where resources that it
    expects to release are not actually allocated (or have been already
    released.)

    If this programs succeeds it should not generate any output.  If this
    program returns an error, any output generated by the program will be
    sent to the zoneadmd message log.

    The following replacements are performed:

      %z	Name of zone

  shutdown

    This is a program which gets run by zoneadmd when a zone is being
    shutdown gracefully. Currently only asynchronous mode is supported.

    If this program succeeds it should not generate any output. If this
    program returns an error, any output generated by the program will be
    sent to the zoneadmd message log.

    The following replacements are performed:

  attach

    Path to a hook that will perform any necessary processing on
    a zone to allow it to be attached.  The zone will be in the "configured"
    state when this hook is run.  This hook is never called when the zone
    is "force attached" (-F).

    If this hook exits with a non-zero exit status, the attach operation
    will fail.

    is "force attached" (-F).

    If this hook exits with a non-zero exit status, the attach operation

    state when this hook is run.

    If this hook exits with a non-zero exit status, the clone operation
    will fail and the zone will be left in the "incomplete" state,
    otherwise the state will be changed to the "installed" state.

    The following replacements are performed:

  postinstall

    Path to a script that will perform any necessary post-processing on
    a zone after it has been freshly installed.  This hook will run after the
    install hook completes and the zone is in the installed state.  The
    additional arguments are the same as what is passed to the install hook.

  predetach

    Path to a hook that will perform any necessary pre-processing on
    a zone before it is detached.  The zone will be in the "installed"
    state when this hook is run.

    It is possible that if the zone fails to detach after invoking this
    hook, future attempts to detach the zone will invoke this hook again.
    So this hook should be designed to gracefully handle the case where
    it is run multiple times on the same zone.  If this hook exits with
    a non-zero exit status, the detach operation will fail.

    This hook is most commonly used when there is pre-processing for detaching
    a zone but the built-in detach support will be used for the actual
    detach.  Otherwise, if a detach hook is provided, then it can be used
    to do both preprocessing as well as the actual detach.

    The following replacements are performed:

  clone
    Path to a hook that will perform any necessary processing on a zone to

  query
    Identifies a hook which can be called to get brand-specific information
