<!--
  device

    Defines a device (or set of devices) to be exported into the zone.

    Its attributes are

      match	Pattern to match under /dev.  Follows fnmatch(3c) rules.
		The following replacements are performed:
			%z	Name of zone

      name	Name of device in non-global zone.  This is optional; the
		default is the same name as the global zone.

      arch	Identifies devices only available for certain architectures.
		Can be "sparc" or "i386".

      ip-type	Optional, identifies devices only available for certain IP
		types. Can be "shared" or "exclusive". If it's not specified,
		the default value "all" will be used, which means it's
		available regardless the IP type.

    For example, the following entry:
	<device match="brand/windows/foo" name="bar" arch="sparc" />
    would result in mapping the following global zone device:
	/dev/brand/windows/foo
    into the zone (disregarding its IP type) as:
	/dev/bar
    but the mapping would only exist on sparc machines.

  symlink

    Defines a symlink to be created under /dev.

    Its attributes are

      source	Link source

      target	Link target

  global_mount

    Describes a filesystem that must be mounted before the zone is booted.
    This mount is performed by a thread executing in the the context of
    the global zone.

    Its attributes are

      special	The special device as used by the mount command.
		This path is relative to the global zone.
		The following replacements are performed:
			%R	Root of zone

      directory	The directory where it will be mounted.
		This path is relative to the non-global zone.

      type	The filesystem type

  platform

    The toplevel container for a virtual platform configuration.  The virtual
    platform describes the basic elements to bring up the necessary services
    (filesystems, devices, etc) to boot the zone.

    Its attributes are

      name	The name of the brand.  This must match the name of the
		directory in which this file is stored, as well as the name
		of the brand that refers to it.
      allow-exclusive-ip	Whether the zones of this brand can have their
				own exclusive IP stack. It is a boolean value.
