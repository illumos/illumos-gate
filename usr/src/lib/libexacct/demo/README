1. Introduction

This directory contains  source code for the "exdump"  utility that uses
libexacct to print the content  of extended accounting files produced by
the kernel.

This  utility   demonstrates  how  developers  can  use   the  libexacct
programming API to extract  extended accounting data. libexacct(3LIB) is
the only interface for reading and  writing  files  in  variable  length
general-purpose accounting file format  used  by  the  kernel  to  store
various types of accounting data.

2. Configuration

Exdump can be compiled as either a 32-bit or 64-bit application; because
exacct is endian-neutral, exdump can read exacct files from either SPARC
or Intel sources on SPARC or Intel platforms. exdump prints one line for
each record it encounters in the exacct file.  

The Makefile contained in this directory is set up to use the C compiler
(cc) and lint  utility found in your  $PATH.  If you wish  to change the
configuration, edit  the CC  and LINT macro  definitions in  Makefile to
point to the appropriate pathnames.

3. Targets

The Makefile in this directory supports the following targets:

	make all (default)	- build exdump executable
	make lint		- run lint against exdump
	make clean		- remove object files
	make clobber		- remove objects, and lint files

To  build the  exdump,  execute  "make" in  this  directory.  This  will
execute the default "make all" target.
