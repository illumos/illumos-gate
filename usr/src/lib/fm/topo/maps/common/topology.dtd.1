  Topology description DTD

    Most attributes are string values (or an individual string from a
    restricted set), but attributes with a specific type requirement are
    noted in the comment describing the element.

<!--
  XInclude support

    Topologies may be composed via the xi:include tag.
    libtopo(3LIB) interfaces enforce that all composed topologies be of the
    same scheme.
