/*
 *		Common Public License Version 0.5
 *
 *		THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF
 *		THIS COMMON PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE,
 *		REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES
 *		RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
 *
 *		1. DEFINITIONS
 *
 *		"Contribution" means:
 *		      a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the
 *		      initial code and documentation distributed under
 *		      this Agreement, and
 *
 *		      b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
 *		      i) changes to the Program, and
 *		      ii) additions to the Program;
 *
 *		      where such changes and/or additions to the Program
 *		      originate from and are distributed by that
 *		      particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates'
 *		      from a Contributor if it was added to the Program
 *		      by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such
 *		      Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include
 *		      additions to the Program which: (i) are separate
 *		      modules of software distributed in conjunction with
 *		      the Program under their own license agreement, and
 *		      (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.
 *
 *
 *		"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes
 *		the Program.
 *
 *		"Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a
 *		Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or
 *		sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the
 *		Program.
 *
 *		"Program" means the Contributions distributed in
 *		accordance with this Agreement.
 *
 *		"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under
 *		this Agreement, including all Contributors.
 *
 *		2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
 *
 *		      a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each
 *		      Contributor hereby grants Recipient a
 *		      no - exclusive, worldwide, royalt - free copyright
 *		      license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of,
 *		      publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and
 *		      sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if
 *		      any, and such derivative works, in source code and
 *		      object code form.
 *
 *		      b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each
 *		      Contributor hereby grants Recipient a
 *		      no - exclusive, worldwide, royalt - free patent
 *		      license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell,
 *		      offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the
 *		      Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source
 *		      code and object code form. This patent license
 *		      shall apply to the combination of the Contribution
 *		      and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is
 *		      added by the Contributor, such addition of the
 *		      Contribution causes such combination to be covered
 *		      by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall
 *		      not apply to any other combinations which include
 *		      the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed
 *		      hereunder.
 *
 *		      c) Recipient understands that although each
 *		      Contributor grants the licenses to its
 *		      Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
 *		      provided by any Contributor that the Program does
 *		      not infringe the patent or other intellectual
 *		      property rights of any other entity. Each
 *		      Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient
 *		      for claims brought by any other entity based on
 *		      infringement of intellectual property rights or
 *		      otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights
 *		      and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient
 *		      hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any
 *		      other intellectual property rights needed, if any.
 *
 *		      For example, if a third party patent license is
 *		      required to allow Recipient to distribute the
 *		      Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to
 *		      acquire that license before distributing the
 *		      Program.
 *
 *		      d) Each Contributor represents that to its
 *		      knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its
 *		      Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright
 *		      license set forth in this Agreement.
 *
 *		3. REQUIREMENTS
 *
 *		A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in
 *		object code form under its own license agreement, provided
 *		that:
 *		      a) it complies with the terms and conditions of
 *		      this Agreement; and
 *
 *		      b) its license agreement:
 *		      i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all
 *		      Contributors all warranties and conditions, express
 *		      and implied, including warranties or conditions of
 *		      title and no - infringement, and implied warranties
 *		      or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a
 *		      particular purpose;
 *
 *		      ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all
 *		      Contributors all liability for damages, including
 *		      direct, indirect, special, incidental and
 *		      consequential damages, such as lost profits;
 *
 *		      iii) states that any provisions which differ from
 *		      this Agreement are offered by that Contributor
 *		      alone and not by any other party; and
 *
 *		      iv) states that source code for the Program is
 *		      available from such Contributor, and informs
 *		      licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner
 *		      on or through a medium customarily used for
 *		      software exchange.
 *
 *		When the Program is made available in source code form:
 *		      a) it must be made available under this Agreement;
 *		      and
 *		      b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with
 *		      each copy of the Program.
 *
 *		Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices
 *		contained within the Program.
 *
 *		Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of
 *		its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably
 *		allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of
 *		the Contribution.
 *
 *
 *		4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
 *
 *		Commercial distributors of software may accept certain
 *		responsibilities with respect to end users, business
 *		partners and the like. While this license is intended to
 *		facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the
 *		Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial
 *		product offering should do so in a manner which does not
 *		create potential liability for other Contributors.
 *		Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a
 *		commercial product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial
 *		Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every
 *		other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any
 *		losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising
 *		from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a
 *		third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the
 *		extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial
 *		Contributor in connection with its distribution of the
 *		Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations
 *		in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses
 *		relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property
 *		infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified
 *		Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial
 *		Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the
 *		Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the
 *		Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related
 *		settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may
 *		participate in any such claim at its own expense.
 *
 *
 *		For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a
 *		commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor
 *		is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial
 *		Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers
 *		warranties related to Product X, those performance claims
 *		and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's
 *		responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial
 *		Contributor would have to defend claims against the other
 *		Contributors related to those performance claims and
 *		warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor
 *		to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor
 *		must pay those damages.
 *
 *
 *		5. NO WARRANTY
 *
 *		EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE
 *		PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT
 *		WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
 *		IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR
 *		CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NO - INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR
 *		FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely
 *		responsible for determining the appropriateness of using
 *		and distributing the Program and assumes all risks
 *		associated with its exercise of rights under this
 *		Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and
 *		costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws,
 *		damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and
 *		unavailability or interruption of operations.
 *
 *		6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
 *		EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER
 *		RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY
 *		FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY,
 *		OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION
 *		LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF
 *		LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT
 *		(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT
 *		OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE
 *		OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
 *		POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 *
 *		7. GENERAL
 *
 *		If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or
 *		unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect
 *		the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the
 *		terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the
 *		parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
 *		minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and
 *		enforceable.
 *
 *
 *		If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a
 *		Contributor with respect to a patent applicable to
 *		software (including a cros - claim or counterclaim in a
 *		lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that
 *		Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall
 *		terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In
 *		addition, If Recipient institutes patent litigation
 *		against any entity (including a cros - claim or
 *		counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program
 *		itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other
 *		software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's
 *		patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under
 *		Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
 *		litigation is filed.
 *
 *		All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall
 *		terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material
 *		terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure
 *		such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming
 *		aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights
 *		under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease
 *		use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably
 *		practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this
 *		Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating
 *		to the Program shall continue and survive.
 *
 *		Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of
 *		this Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the
 *		Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the
 *		following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right
 *		to publish new versions (including revisions) of this
 *		Agreement from time to time. No one other than the
 *		Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement.
 *
 *		IBM is the initial Agreement Steward. IBM may assign the
 *		responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a
 *		suitable separate entity. Each new version of the
 *		Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number.
 *		The Program (including Contributions) may always be
 *		distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under
 *		which it was received. In addition, after a new version of
 *		the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to
 *		distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under
 *		the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections
 *		2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or
 *		licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor
 *		under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,
 *		estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not
 *		expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.
 *
 *
 *		This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New
 *		York and the intellectual property laws of the United
 *		States of America. No party to this Agreement will bring a
 *		legal action under this Agreement more than one year after
 *		the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to
 *		a jury trial in any resulting litigation.
