# The link-editor related source files and Makefile files have at times been
# unified across all presently maintained release gates.  However, some of the
# compiler pre-processor flags and link-editor flags are different among the
# releases.  This file is used to specify such flags. 
# 
# This file is included by ./Makefile.com, but may also be included directly in
# the case where the utility is relying on the contents of ../../Makefile.com.
# 
# This file should be the only file which is different among the presently
# maintained release workspaces, when the sources are unified.
#
# CPPFEATUREMACROS provides for selectively turning on/off features within the
# various link-editor components.  Presently, none are set.
#
# Some source files need to use #ifdef to distinguish between the patch release,
# and for the packages targeting to the pre-libc/libthread unified environment.
# These values are available for CPPFLAGS:
#	
#	SGS_PRE_UNIFIED_PROCESS
#
#		is set if the target release is for pre-libc/libthread unified
#		environment. This is used for rtld and crle.

#
# The avl.h and avl_impl.h files are under usr/src/uts/common/sys in

# in Solaris 9 and earlier.
#
# For Solaris 9 and earlier releases, we will have our own copy of the
# files avl.c, avl.h and avl_impl.h until these files are back ported into
