# Note: This mapfile is used to place r_debug as the
# very first data item inside of the run-time linker.
# This is required for the ld.so.1 <--> rtld_db bootstraping
# for debuggers.
#
# The issue with this is that different compilers may not agree on the name of
# the section this data will be placed in.  So we must have a mapfile for
# each, though at present GCC is the only compiler.
