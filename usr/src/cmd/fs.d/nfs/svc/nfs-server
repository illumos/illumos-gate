# Handling a corner case here. If we were in offline state due to an
# unsatisfied dependency, the ipf_method process wouldn't have generated
# the ipfilter configuration. When we transition to online because the
# dependency is satisfied, the start method will have to generate the
# ipfilter configuration. To avoid all possible deadlock scenarios,
# we restart ipfilter which will regenerate the ipfilter configuration
# for the entire system.
#
# The ipf_method process signals that it didn't generate ipf rules by
# removing the service's ipf file. Thus we only restart network/ipfilter
# when the file is missing.
