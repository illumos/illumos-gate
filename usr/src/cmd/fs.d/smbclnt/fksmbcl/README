This directory builds a program linking all of the SMB client code
into a user-level process.  The result is not a fully functional
SMB client but is very useful for some kinds of development work.

The architecture of this roughly parallels the in-kernel version,
where the kernel modules are built as libraries including:
  libfksmbfs, libfknsmb

Just as with the kernel code, there are mdb modules that know
how to walk data structures in libfksmbfs, etc.

For debugging, etc. it's easiest to run this as a normal user,
i.e. yourself (not root)

Now you can run fksmbcl from the proto area using this script:
  ./Run.sh -df

You can also run it under dbx (see the .dbxrc file).
To run it under mdb (with mdb modules build here):
  mdb -L $ROOT/usr/lib/mdb/proc:/usr/lib/mdb/proc ...
where ... is one of: fksmbcl, core.nnn, -p $PID

There are also some dtrace scripts in here, and in ../dtrace
for watching either all activity or only selected areas.
Run these like:  dtrace -s Watch-all.d -p $PID -o output

These two (from over in ../dtrace) also work with fksmbcl:
	dtrace -s fksmbcl.d -p `pgrep fksmbcl`  -o output

Here is the help output:

	> help
	Commands:
	help 
	exit 
	logon [user [dom [pass]]]
	logoff [close-driver]
	shares 
	mount {share} [optstr]
	umount 
	unmount 
	statfs 
	dir {rdir} [lfile]
	dirx {rdir} [lfile]
	get {rfile} [lfile]
	put {lfile} [rfile]
	mv {from} {to}
	rm {rfile}
	mkdir {rfile}
	rmdir {rfile}
	opt {option}


Here is an example of how to connect, mount, and list a directory:

	$ ./Run.sh //myserver
	# Start with:
	> logon [user [dom [pw]]]
	> shares
	> mount {share}

	> logon test test test
	> shares
	open pipe: /srvsvc
	enum strings
	junk
	c$
	Default Share
	test1
	ipc$
	Remote IPC
	test
	> mount test
	> dir
	    1224750917    .
	    1224750917    ..
	     900818955    test9.dat
	    3908265151    lock1.txt
	    2452346625    test_dir
	> umount
	> logoff
	> exit
	$
