GLXXX: Instance creation guidelines:

Currently inetd doesn't support property composition in the configuration of
it's instances. It expects to find the "proto" property in the instances
"inetd_private" property group, and all other properties (including the
default back ones) in the "inetd_private" property group of the service.
This means that only the "proto" field can be specialized for an instance, which
limits the creation of instances of a service to only those with all fields
common, bar the "proto" field. This would enable the following two services
to be created as instances of a common service: 

exec    stream  tcp     nowait  root    /usr/sbin/in.rexecd     in.rexecd
exec    stream  tcp6    nowait  root    /usr/sbin/in.rexecd     in.rexecd 

but dissallow common service create for these (different socket type):

time    stream  tcp6    nowait  root    internal
time    dgram   udp6    wait    root    internal

To be more specific, for rpc services all the netids associated with the
service would need a seperate instance creating under a common service, with
the instance name and the "proto" being the netid. For non-rpc based
services only services with changes limited to the "proto" field (such as
udp/upd6 and tcp/tcp6) can have instances created under a common service - as
in the exec example above.

I neglected to mention that the composition limitation applies for methods
also, so an instance can't have a different method than its service.

Inetd is soon going to change to use instance composition for its configuration.
This will mean that any of the properties/methods can be present in either the
instance or the service (with the instance one overriding in the case both are
present) and that multiple instances can be created for a service with the 
potential to specialize all the properties/methods.
