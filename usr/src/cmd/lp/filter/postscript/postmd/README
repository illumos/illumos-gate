A program that can be used to display a matrix as a gray scale image on PostScript
printers. May be useful if you have a large matrix and want a simple way to look
for patterns. Although I haven't been anywhere close, I expect a 600x600 matrix
is a very optimistic upper bound on a 300 dpi printer using 5 shades of gray and
8.5x11 inch paper.

Matrix elements are a series of floating point numbers arranged in the input file
in row major order. By default each matrix is assumed to be square and the number
of rows (and columns) is set to the square root of the number of elements in the
input file. White space, including newlines, is not used to determine the matrix
dimensions. Each matrix element is mapped into an integer in the range 0 to 255
(254 by default) and PostScript's image operator maps that integer into a gray
scale appropriate for your printer.

The mapping from floating point matrix elements to integers is controlled by an
interval list and grayscale map. The default interval list is "-1,0,1" which
partitions the real line into 7 regions, while the default grayscale map gets
darker as the regions move from left to right along the real line. The -i option
changes the interval list and the -g option modifies the grayscale mapping. Check
the man page for more details.

By default 6 byte patterns are used, but any number can be selected with the -b
option. 6 byte patterns are a tradeoff that achieves a good (but not necessarily
optimal) performance across the wide variety of currently available PostScript
printers. Decreasing the pattern size often helps some on printers with fast
processors (eg. PS-810s) while increasing the pattern size speeds things up on
older printers (eg. PS-800s). In the limited number of tests I ran -b10 worked
best on PS800s and -b4 gave the best performance on PS-810s. If you want a
different default pattern size change the initialization of bytespp (near line
175 in postmd.c) before you compile the program.
