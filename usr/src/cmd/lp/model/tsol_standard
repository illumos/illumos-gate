#
# The protocol between the interface program and the Spooler
# is fairly simple:
#
#	All standard error output is assumed to indicate a
#	fault WITH THE REQUEST. The output is mailed to the
#	user who submitted the print request and the print
#	request is finished.
#
#	If the interface program sets a zero exit code,
#	it is assumed that the file printed correctly.
#	If the interface program sets a non-zero exit code
#	less than 128, it is assumed that the file did not
#	print correctly, and the user will be notified.
#	In either case the print request is finished.
#
#	If the interface program sets an exit code greater
#	than 128, it is assumed that the file did not print
#	because of a printer fault. If an alert isn't already
#	active (see below) one will be activated. (Exit code
#	128 should not be used at all. The shell, which executes
#	this program, turns SIGTERM, used to kill this program
#	for a cancellation or disabling, into exit 128. The
#	Spooler thus interpretes 128 as SIGTERM.)
#
#	A message sent to the standard input of the ${LPTELL}
#	program is assumed to describe a fault WITH THE PRINTER.
#	The output is used in an alert (if alerts are defined).
#	If the fault recovery is "wait" or "begin", the printer
#	is disabled (killing the interface program if need be),
#	and the print request is left on the queue.
#	If the fault recovery is "continue", the interface program
#	is allowed to wait for the printer fault to be cleared so
#	it can resume printing.
#
# This interface program relies on filters to detect printer faults.
# In absence of a filter provided by the customer, it uses a simple
# filter (${LPCAT}) to detect the class of faults that cause DCD
# (``carrier'') drop. The protocol between the interface program and
# the filter:
#
#	The filter should exit with zero if printing was
#	successful and non-zero if printing failed because
#	of a printer fault. This interface program turns a
#	non-zero exit of the filter into an "exit 129" from
#	itself, thus telling the Spooler that a printer fault
#	(still) exists.
#
#	The filter should report printer faults via a message
#	to its standard error. This interface program takes all
#	standard error output from the filter and feeds it as
#	standard input to the ${LPTELL} program.
#
#	The filter should wait for a printer fault to clear,
#	and should resume printing when the fault clears.
#	Preferably it should resume at the top of the page
#	that was being printed when the fault occurred.
#	If it waits and finishes printing, it should exit
#	with a 0 exit code. If it can't wait, it should exit
#	with a non-zero exit code.
#
#	The interface program expects that ANY message on the
#	standard error from the filter indicates a printer fault.
#	Therefore, a filter should not put user (input) error
#	messages on the standard error, but on the standard output
#	(where the user can read them when he or she examines
#	the print-out).

			# Here's where we print the file.
			#
			# We set up a pipeline to $LPTELL, but play a trick
			# to get the filter's standard ERROR piped instead of
			# its standard OUTPUT: Divert the standard error (#2) to
			# the standard output (#1) IN THE PIPELINE. The shell
			# will have changed #1 to be the pipe, not the
			# printer, so diverting #2 connects it to the pipe.
			# We then change the filter's #1 to a copy of the real
			# standard output (the printer port) made earlier,
			# so that is connected back to the printer again.
			#
			# We do all this inside a parenthesized expression
			# so that we can get the exit code; this is necessary
			# because the exit code of a pipeline is the exit
			# code of the right-most command, which isn't the
			# filter.
			#
			# These two tricks could be avoided by using a named
			# pipe to connect the standard error to $LPTELL. In
			# fact an early prototype of this script did just
			# that; however, the named pipe introduced a timing
			# problem. The processes that open a named pipe hang
			# until both ends of the pipe are opened. Cancelling
			# a request or disabling the printer often killed one
			# of the processes, causing the other process to hang
			# forever waiting for the other end of the pipe to
