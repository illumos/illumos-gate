# This is the second phase of TCP/IP configuration.  The first part is
# run by the svc:/network/physical service and includes configuring the
# interfaces and setting the machine's hostname.  The svc:/network/initial
# service does all configuration that can be done before name services are
# started, bar configuring IP routing (this is carried out by the
# svc:/network/routing-setup service).  The final part, run by the
# svc:/network/service service,  does all configuration that may require
# name services.  This includes a final re-configuration of the
# interfaces.
