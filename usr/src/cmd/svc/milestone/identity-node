# For the GZ, use one of the following values for hostname, in order:
#   * DHCP hostname (if set on a primary interface)
#   * hostname value from config file
#   * hostname bootparam
#   * if not a headnode:
#     * admin MAC address
#     * any other MAC address
#
# If none of the above could be found, default to "headnode" for headnodes, and
# "unknown" for non-headnodes.
#
# The hostname must be set to something, because
# tooltalk will hang unless the name can be locally resolved.
# Sendmail also requires the name to be resolvable locally.
# Later, in inetsvc, we create a name "unknown" and create a entry
# in the local /etc/inet/hosts file pairing "unknown" with the IP
# address assigned by DHCP.  The use of bootparams as a fallback
# for all non-DHCP cases provides compatibility with the
# behavior of the system before netstrategy was introduced.
#
# For non-global zones, fall back to the `uname -n` value provided by the
# kernel if /etc/nodename does not exist, as is expected on an initial boot.
