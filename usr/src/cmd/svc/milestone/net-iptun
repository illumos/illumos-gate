# Configure tunnels which were deferred by /lib/svc/method/net-physical (the
# svc:/network/physical service) since it depends on the tunnel source
# addresses being available.
#
# WARNING: you may wish to turn OFF forwarding if you haven't already, because
# of various possible security vulnerabilities when configuring tunnels for
# Virtual Private Network (VPN) construction.
#
# Also, if names are used in the /etc/hostname*.* files, those names have to
# be in either DNS (and DNS is used) or in /etc/hosts, because this file is
# executed before NIS or NIS+ is started.
