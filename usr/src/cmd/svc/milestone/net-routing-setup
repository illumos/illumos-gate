# addresses of one or more default routers.  If hostnames are used,

# because NIS is not running at the time that this script is
# run.  Each router name or address is listed on a single line by
# itself in the file.  Anything else on that line after the router's
# name or address is ignored.  Lines that begin with "#" are
# considered comments and ignored.

# replace those added by the kernel during diskless booting.  An
# empty "/etc/defaultrouter" file will cause the default route
# added by the kernel to be deleted.
#
# Note that the default router file is ignored if we received routes
# from a DHCP server.  Our policy is to always trust DHCP over local
# administration.
