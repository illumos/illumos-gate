"For the avoidance of doubt, except that if any license choice other 
than GPL or LGPL is available it will apply instead, Sun elects to 
use only the General Public License version 3 (GPLv3) at this time 
for any software where a choice of GPL license versions is made 
available with the language indicating that GPLv3 or any later 
version may be used, or where a choice of which version of the GPL 
is applied is otherwise unspecified."
