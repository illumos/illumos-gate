The /usr/share/lib/zoneinfo/src directory contains zoneinfo timezone source
files.  These source files have been compiled using zic(1M) to create
the zoneinfo data files in /usr/share/lib/zoneinfo.  The zic command can be
used with the zoneinfo source files to create additional data files.

The zoneinfo files track the Olson public source provided at
ftp://elsie.nci.nih.gov/pub/, therefore zoneinfo files may be added and
removed as the Solaris source is updated.  The current Solaris release of
the zoneinfo files is based on tzdata2010k.tar.gz.

The /usr/share/lib/zoneinfo/GMT[+-]* timezones listed below have been
removed from the release.  Replace usage of the
/usr/share/lib/zoneinfo/GMT[+-]* files with the equivalent quoted timezone
(see environ(5)).  Note the signs of the offsets of the equivalent quoted
timezone are reversed from the signs of the /usr/share/lib/zoneinfo/GMT[+-]*
files.

For example, replace TZ=:GMT+1, with TZ="<GMT-1>-1".  (The colon (:) is
significant.  Without the colon, for example TZ=GMT+1, an unquoted timezone
is used;  unquoted timezones are not affected by the removal of the zoneinfo
timezone files listed below.)

The following files have been removed from the release:

/usr/share/lib/zoneinfo/GMT-12
/usr/share/lib/zoneinfo/GMT-11
/usr/share/lib/zoneinfo/GMT-10
/usr/share/lib/zoneinfo/GMT-9
/usr/share/lib/zoneinfo/GMT-8
/usr/share/lib/zoneinfo/GMT-7
/usr/share/lib/zoneinfo/GMT-6
/usr/share/lib/zoneinfo/GMT-5
/usr/share/lib/zoneinfo/GMT-4
/usr/share/lib/zoneinfo/GMT-3
/usr/share/lib/zoneinfo/GMT-2
/usr/share/lib/zoneinfo/GMT-1
/usr/share/lib/zoneinfo/GMT+1
/usr/share/lib/zoneinfo/GMT+2
/usr/share/lib/zoneinfo/GMT+3
/usr/share/lib/zoneinfo/GMT+4
/usr/share/lib/zoneinfo/GMT+5
/usr/share/lib/zoneinfo/GMT+6
/usr/share/lib/zoneinfo/GMT+7
/usr/share/lib/zoneinfo/GMT+8
/usr/share/lib/zoneinfo/GMT+9
/usr/share/lib/zoneinfo/GMT+10
/usr/share/lib/zoneinfo/GMT+11
/usr/share/lib/zoneinfo/GMT+12
/usr/share/lib/zoneinfo/GMT+13

As zoneinfo timezones are updated, the savings/daylight transition rules
and timezone name abbreviations may change.  This can affect how 
the times are calculated in the local timezone.  Therefore the interpretation
of a time_t value can vary amongst Solaris releases that use different
versions of the zoneinfo timezones.

The zoneinfo timezone data files do not transition past
Tue Jan 19 03:14:07 2038 GMT.  Therefore for 64-bit applications using
zoneinfo timezones, calculations beyond this date may not use the correct
offset from standard time, and could return incorrect values.  This affects
64-bit versions of interfaces such as ascftime(3C), cftime(3C), ctime(3C),
getdate(3C), ftime(3C), mktime(3C), and localtime(3C).

For more information see zic(1M), zdump(1M), environ(5), TIMEZONE(4),
ctime(3C), and mktime(3C) man pages.
