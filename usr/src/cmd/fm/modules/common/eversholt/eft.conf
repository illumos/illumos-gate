# fmd configuration file for the eft.so diagnosis engine.
#
# The following configuration options are valid:
#
#	setprop autoclose [all|upsets]
#
#		Turns on automatic closing of cases after they've
#		been solved.  Useful if no agent is available to
#		act upon a published diagnosis.  Setting autoclose
#		to "all" closes all cases automatcally, setting it
#		to "upsets" closes only those containing only upsets.
#
#	setprop estats true
#
#		Enables "extended stats" visible via "fmstat -m eft".
#		Useful only when doing performance work on eft.so.
#
#	setprop status <filename>
#
#		Tracks status of internal fault management exercises
#		to the given file each time the status changes.
#		Dumps an even larger amount of information if verbose
#		is also set.  Note that every ereport received and
#		every timer that expires will cause the file to grow.
#
#	setprop verbose <level>
#
#		Increase debugging verbosity to <level> (1, 2, or 3).
#
#	setprop warn true
#
#		Turns on EFT file language warnings.  Useful only
#		in very obscure debugging cases.
#
#	setprop maxfme <integer>
#
#		Sets the maximum number of open fault management exercises.
#		The value "0" (zero) specifies no limit.
