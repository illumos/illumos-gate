Because the device is part of a mirror or\nRAID-Z device, ZFS was able to recover from the error and subsequently repair\nthe damaged data.\n\nIf these errors persist over a period of time, ZFS may determine the\ndevice is faulty and mark it as such.  However, these error counts may or may\nnot indicate that the device is unusable.  It depends on how the errors were\ncaused, which the administrator can determine in advance of any ZFS diagnosis.\nFor example, the following cases will all produce errors that do not indicate\npotential device failure:\n\n\nA network attached device lost connectivity but has now\nrecovered\nA device suffered from a bit flip, an expected event over long\nperiods of time\nAn administrator accidentally wrote over a portion of the disk using\nanother program\n\n\nIn these cases, the presence of errors does not indicate that the\ndevice is likely to fail in the future, and therefore does not need to be\nreplaced.  If this is the case, then the device errors should be cleared using\n'zpool clear':\n\n\n# zpool clear test c0t0d0\n\n\nOn the other hand, errors may very well indicate that the device has\nfailed or is about to fail.  If there are continual I/O errors to a device that\nis otherwise attached and functioning on the system, it most likely needs to be\nreplaced.   The administrator should check the system log for any driver\nmessages that may indicate hardware failure.  If it is determined that the\ndevice needs to be replaced, then the 'zpool replace' command should be\nused:\n\n\n# zpool replace test c0t0d0 c0t0d2\n\n\nThis will attach the new device to the pool and begin resilvering data\nto it.  Once the resilvering process is complete, the old device will\nautomatically be removed from the pool, at which point it can safely be removed\nfrom the system.  If the device needs to be replaced in-place (because there are\nno available spare devices), the original device can be removed and replaced\nwith a new device, at which point a different form of 'zpool replace' can be\nused:\n\n\n# zpool replace test c0t0d0\n\n\nThis assumes that the original device at 'c0t0d0' has been replaced\nwith a new device under the same path, and will be replaced\nappropriately.\n\nYou can monitor the progress of the resilvering operation by using the\n'zpool status -x' command:\n\n\n# zpool status -x\n  pool: test\n state: DEGRADED\nstatus: One or more devices is currently being replaced.  The pool may not be\n	providing the necessary level of replication.\naction: Wait for the resilvering operation to complete\n scrub: resilver in progress, 0.14% done, 0h0m to go\nconfig:\n\n        NAME                  STATE     READ WRITE CKSUM\n        test                  ONLINE       0     0     0\n          mirror              ONLINE       0     0     0\n            replacing         ONLINE       0     0     0\n              c0t0d0          ONLINE       0     0     3\n              c0t0d2          ONLINE       0     0     0  58.5K resilvered\n            c0t0d1            ONLINE       0     0     0\n\nerrors: No known data errors\n\n	"
