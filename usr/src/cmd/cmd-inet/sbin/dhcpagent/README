Architectural Overview for the DHCP agent
Peter Memishian
ident	"%Z%%M%	%I%	%E% SMI"

INTRODUCTION
============

The Solaris DHCP agent (dhcpagent) is an RFC2131-compliant DHCP client
implementation.  The major forces shaping its design were:

	* Must be capable of managing multiple network interfaces.
	* Must consume little CPU, since it will always be running.
	* Must have a small memory footprint, since it will always be
	  running.
	* Must not rely on any shared libraries, since it must run
	  before all filesystems have been mounted.

When a DHCP agent implementation is only required to control a single
interface on a machine, the problem is expressed well as a simple
state-machine, as shown in RFC2131.  However, when a DHCP agent is
responsible for managing more than one interface at a time, the
problem becomes much more complicated, especially when threads cannot
be used to attack the problem (since the filesystems containing the
thread libraries may not be available when the agent starts).
Instead, the problem must be solved using an event-driven model, which
while tried-and-true, is subtle and easy to get wrong.  Indeed, much
of the agent's code is there to manage the complexity of programming
in an asynchronous event-driven paradigm.

THE BASICS
==========

The DHCP agent consists of roughly 20 source files, most with a
companion header file.  While the largest source file is around 700
lines, most are much shorter.  The source files can largely be broken
up into three groups:

	* Source files, which along with their companion header files,
	  define an abstract "object" that is used by other parts of
	  the system.  Examples include "timer_queue.c", which along
	  with "timer_queue.h" provide a Timer Queue object for use
	  by the rest of the agent, and "async.c", which along with
	  "async.h" defines an interface for managing asynchronous
	  transactions within the agent.

	* Source files which implement a given state of the agent; for
	  instance, there is a "request.c" which comprises all of
	  the procedural "work" which must be done while in the
	  REQUESTING state of the agent.  By encapsulating states in
	  files, it becomes easier to debug errors in the
	  client/server protocol and adapt the agent to new
	  constraints, since all the relevant code is in one place.

	* Source files, which along with their companion header files,
  	  encapsulate a given task or related set of tasks.  The
	  difference between this and the first group is that the
	  interfaces exported from these files do not operate on
	  an "object", but rather perform a specific task.  Examples
	  include "dlpi_io.c", which provides a useful interface
	  to DLPI-related i/o operations.

OVERVIEW
========

Here we discuss the essential objects and subtle aspects of the
DHCP agent implementation.  Note that there is of course much more
that is not discussed here, but after this overview you should be able 
to fend for yourself in the source code.

Event Handlers and Timer Queues
-------------------------------

The most important object in the agent is the event handler, whose
interface is in libinetutil.h and whose implementation is in
libinetutil.  The event handler is essentially an object-oriented
wrapper around poll(2): other components of the agent can register to
be called back when specific events on file descriptors happen -- for
instance, to wait for requests to arrive on its IPC socket, the agent
registers a callback function (accept_event()) that will be called
back whenever a new connection arrives on the file descriptor
associated with the IPC socket.  When the agent initially begins in
main(), it registers a number of events with the event handler, and
then calls iu_handle_events(), which proceeds to wait for events to
happen -- this function does not return until the agent is shutdown
via signal.

When the registered events occur, the callback functions are called
back, which in turn might lead to additional callbacks being
registered -- this is the classic event-driven model.  (As an aside,
note that programming in an event-driven model means that callbacks
cannot block, or else the agent will become unresponsive.)

A special kind of "event" is a timeout.  Since there are many timers
which must be maintained for each DHCP-controlled interface (such as a
lease expiration timer, time-to-first-renewal (t1) timer, and so
forth), an object-oriented abstraction to timers called a "timer
queue" is provided, whose interface is in libinetutil.h with a
corresponding implementation in libinetutil.  The timer queue allows
callback functions to be "scheduled" for callback after a certain
amount of time has passed.

The event handler and timer queue objects work hand-in-hand: the event
handler is passed a pointer to a timer queue in iu_handle_events() --
from there, it can use the iu_earliest_timer() routine to find the
timer which will next fire, and use this to set its timeout value in
its call to poll(2).  If poll(2) returns due to a timeout, the event
handler calls iu_expire_timers() to expire all timers that expired
(note that more than one may have expired if, for example, multiple
timers were set to expire at the same time).

Although it is possible to instantiate more than one timer queue or
event handler object, it doesn't make a lot of sense -- these objects
are really "singletons".  Accordingly, the agent has two global
variables, `eh' and `tq', which store pointers to the global event
handler and timer queue.

Network Interfaces
------------------

For each network interface managed by the agent, there is a set of
associated state that describes both its general properties (such as
the maximum MTU) and its DHCP-related state (such as when it acquired
a lease).  This state is stored in a a structure called an `ifslist',
which is a poor name (since it suggests implementation artifacts but
not purpose) but has historical precedent.  Another way to think about 
an `ifslist' is that it provides all of the context necessary to
perform DHCP on a given interface: the state the interface is in, the
last packet DHCP packet received on that interface, and so forth.  As
one can imagine, the `ifslist' structure is quite complicated and rules
governing accessing its fields are equally convoluted -- see the
comments in interface.h for more information.

One point that was brushed over in the preceding discussion of event
handlers and timer queues was context.  Recall that the event-driven
nature of the agent requires that functions cannot block, lest they
starve out others and impact the observed responsiveness of the agent.
As an example, consider the process of extending a lease: the agent
must send a REQUEST packet and wait for an ACK or NAK packet in
response.  This is done by sending a REQUEST and then registering a
callback with the event handler that waits for an ACK or NAK packet to
arrive on the file descriptor associated with the interface.  Note
however, that when the ACK or NAK does arrive, and the callback
function called back, it must know which interface this packet is for
(it must get back its context).  This could be handled through an
ad-hoc mapping of file descriptors to interfaces, but a cleaner
approach is to have the event handler's register function
(iu_register_event()) take in an opaque context pointer, which will
then be passed back to the callback.  In the agent, this context
pointer is always the `ifslist', but for reasons of decoupling and
generality, the timer queue and event handler objects allow a generic
(void *) context argument.

Note that there is nothing that guarantees the pointer passed into
iu_register_event() or iu_schedule_timer() will still be valid when
the callback is called back (for instance, the memory may have been
freed in the meantime).  To solve this problem, ifslists are reference
counted.  For more details on how the reference count scheme is
implemented, see the closing comments in interface.h regarding memory
management.

Transactions
------------

Many operations performed via DHCP must be performed in groups -- for
instance, acquiring a lease requires several steps: sending a
DISCOVER, collecting OFFERs, selecting an OFFER, sending a REQUEST,
and receiving an ACK, assuming everything goes well.  Note however
that due to the event-driven model the agent operates in, these
operations are not inherently "grouped" -- instead, the agent sends a
DISCOVER, goes back into the main event loop, waits for events
(perhaps even requests on the IPC channel to begin acquiring a lease
on another interface), eventually checks to see if an acceptable OFFER
has come in, and so forth.  To some degree, the notion of the current
state of an interface (SELECTING, REQUESTING, etc) helps control the
potential chaos of the event-driven model (for instance, if while the
agent is waiting for an OFFER on a given interface, an IPC event comes
in requesting that the interface be RELEASED, the agent knows to send
back an error since the interface must be in at least the BOUND state
before a RELEASE can be performed.)

However, states are not enough -- for instance, suppose that the agent
begins trying to renew a lease -- this is done by sending a REQUEST
packet and waiting for an ACK or NAK, which might never come.  If,
while waiting for the ACK or NAK, the user sends a request to renew
the lease as well, then if the agent were to send another REQUEST,
things could get quite complicated (and this is only the beginning of
this rathole).  To protect against this, two objects exist:
`async_action' and `ipc_action'.  These objects are related, but
independent of one another; the more essential object is the
`async_action', which we will discuss first.

In short, an `async_action' represents a pending transaction (aka
asynchronous action), of which each interface can have at most one.
The `async_action' structure is embedded in the `ifslist' structure,
which is fine since there can be at most one pending transaction per
interface.  Typical "asynchronous transactions" are START, EXTEND, and
INFORM, since each consists of a sequence of packets that must be done
without interruption.  Note that not all DHCP operations are
"asynchronous" -- for instance, a RELEASE operation is synchronous
(not asynchronous) since after the RELEASE is sent no reply is
expected from the DHCP server.  Also, note that there can be
synchronous operations intermixed with asynchronous operations
although it's not recommended.

When the agent realizes it must perform an asynchronous transaction,
it first calls async_pending() to see if there is already one pending;
if so, the new transaction must fail (the details of failure depend on
how the transaction was initiated, which is described in more detail
later when the `ipc_action' object is discussed).  If there is no
pending asynchronous transaction, async_start() is called to begin
one.

When the transaction is complete, async_finish() must be called to
complete the asynchronous action on that interface.  If the
transaction is unable to complete within a certain amount of time
(more on this later), async_timeout() is invoked which attempts to
cancel the asynchronous action with async_cancel().  If the event is
not cancellable it is left pending, although this means that no future
asynchronous actions can be performed on the interface until the
transaction voluntarily calls async_finish().  While this may seem
suboptimal, cancellation here is quite analogous to thread
cancellation, which is generally considered a difficult problem.

The notion of asynchronous transactions is complicated by the fact
that they may originate from both inside and outside of the agent.
For instance, a user initiates an asynchronous START transaction when
he performs an `ifconfig hme0 dhcp start', but the agent will
internally need to perform asynchronous EXTEND transactions to extend
the lease before it expires.  This leads us into the `ipc_action'
object.

An `ipc_action' represents the IPC-related pieces of an asynchronous
transaction that was started as a result of a user request.  Only
IPC-generated asynchronous transactions have a valid `ipc_action'
object.  Note that since there can be at most one asynchronous action
per interface, there can also be at most one `ipc_action' per
interface (this means it can also conveniently be embedded inside the
`ifslist' structure).

One of the main purposes of the `ipc_action' object is to timeout user 
events.  This is not the same as timing out the transaction; for
instance, when the user specifies a timeout value as an argument to
ifconfig, he is specifying an `ipc_action' timeout; in other words,
how long he is willing to wait for the command to complete.  However,
even after the command times out for the user, the asynchronous
transaction continues until async_timeout() occurs.

It is worth understanding these timeouts since the relationship is
subtle but powerful.  The `async_action' timer specifies how long the
agent will try to perform the transaction; the `ipc_action' timer
specifies how long the user is willing to wait for the action to
complete.  If when the `async_action' timer fires and async_timeout()
is called, there is no associated `ipc_action' (either because the
transaction was not initiated by a user or because the user already
timed out), then async_cancel() proceeds as described previously.  If,
on the other hand, the user is still waiting for the transaction to
complete, then async_timeout() is rescheduled and the transaction is
left pending.  While this behavior might seem odd, it adheres to the
principles of least surprise: when a user is willing to wait for a
transaction to complete, the agent should try for as long as they're
willing to wait.  On the other hand, if the agent were to take that
stance with its internal transactions, it would block out
user-requested operations if the internal transaction never completed
(perhaps because the server never sent an ACK in response to our lease
extension REQUEST).

The API provided for the `ipc_action' object is quite similar to the
one for the `async_action' object: when an IPC request comes in for an 
operation requiring asynchronous operation, ipc_action_start() is
called.  When the request completes, ipc_action_finish() is called.
If the user times out before the request completes, then
ipc_action_timeout() is called.

Packet Management
-----------------

Another complicated area is packet management: building, manipulating,
sending and receiving packets.  These operations are all encapsulated
behind a dozen or so interfaces (see packet.h) that abstract the
unimportant details away from the rest of the agent code.  In order to
send a DHCP packet, code first calls init_pkt(), which returns a
dhcp_pkt_t initialized suitably for transmission.  Note that currently
init_pkt() returns a dhcp_pkt_t that is actually allocated as part of
the `ifslist', but this may change in the future..  After calling
init_pkt(), the add_pkt_opt*() functions are used to add options to
the DHCP packet.  Finally, send_pkt() can be used to transmit the
packet to a given IP address.

The send_pkt() function is actually quite complicated; for one, it
must internally use either DLPI or sockets depending on the state of
the interface; for two, it handles the details of packet timeout and
retransmission.  The last argument to send_pkt() is a pointer to a
"stop function".  If this argument is passed as NULL, then the packet
will only be sent once (it won't be retransmitted).  Otherwise, before
each retransmission, the stop function will be called back prior to
retransmission.  The return value from this function indicates whether
to continue retransmission or not, which allows the send_pkt() caller
to control the retransmission policy without making it have to deal
with the retransmission mechanism.  See init_reboot.c for an example
of this in action.

The recv_pkt() function is simpler but still complicated by the fact
that one may want to receive several different types of packets at
once; for instance, after sending a REQUEST, either an ACK or a NAK is
acceptable.  Also, before calling recv_pkt(), the caller must know
that there is data to be read from the socket (this can be
accomplished by using the event handler), otherwise recv_pkt() will
block, which is clearly not acceptable.

Time
----

The notion of time is an exceptionally subtle area.  You will notice
five ways that time is represented in the source: as lease_t's,
uint32_t's, time_t's, hrtime_t's, and monosec_t's.  Each of these
types serves a slightly different function.

The `lease_t' type is the simplest to understand; it is the unit of
time in the CD_{LEASE,T1,T2}_TIME options in a DHCP packet, as defined
by RFC2131. This is defined as a positive number of seconds (relative
to some fixed point in time) or the value `-1' (DHCP_PERM) which
represents infinity (i.e., a permanent lease).  The lease_t should be
used either when dealing with actual DHCP packets that are sent on the
wire or for variables which follow the exact definition given in the
RFC.

The `uint32_t' type is also used to represent a relative time in
seconds.  However, here the value `-1' is not special and of course
this type is not tied to any definition given in RFC2131.  Use this
for representing "offsets" from another point in time that are not
DHCP lease times.

The `time_t' type is the natural Unix type for representing time since
the epoch.  Unfortunately, it is affected by stime(2) or adjtime(2)
and since the DHCP client is used during system installation (and thus
when time is typically being configured), the time_t cannot be used in
general to represent an absolute time since the epoch.  For instance,
if a time_t were used to keep track of when a lease began, and then a
minute later stime(2) was called to adjust the system clock forward a
year, then the lease would appeared to have expired a year ago even
though it has only been a minute.  For this reason, time_t's should
only be used either when wall time must be displayed (such as in
DHCP_STATUS ipc transaction) or when a time meaningful across reboots
must be obtained (such as when caching an ACK packet at system
shutdown).

The `hrtime_t' type returned from gethrtime() works around the
limitations of the time_t in that it is not affected by stime(2) or
adjtime(2), with the disadvantage that it represents time from some
arbitrary time in the past and in nanoseconds.  The timer queue code
deals with hrtime_t's directly since that particular piece of code is
meant to be fairly independent of the rest of the DHCP client.

However, dealing with nanoseconds is error-prone when all the other
time types are in seconds.  As a result, yet another time type, the
`monosec_t' was created to represent a monotonically increasing time
in seconds, and is really no more than (hrtime_t / NANOSEC).  Note
that this unit is typically used where time_t's would've traditionally
been used.  The function monosec() in util.c returns the current
monosec, and monosec_to_time() can convert a given monosec to wall
time, using the system's current notion of time.

One additional limitation of the `hrtime_t' and `monosec_t' types is
that they are unaware of the passage of time across checkpoint/resume
events (e.g., those generated by sys-suspend(1M)).  For example, if
gethrtime() returns time T, and then the machine is suspended for 2
hours, and then gethrtime() is called again, the time returned is not
T + (2 * 60 * 60 * NANOSEC), but rather approximately still T.

To work around this (and other checkpoint/resume related problems),
when a system is resumed, the DHCP client makes the pessimistic
assumption that all finite leases have expired while the machine was
suspended and must be obtained again.  This is known as "refreshing"
the leases, and is handled by refresh_ifslist().

Note that it appears like a more intelligent approach would be to
record the time(2) when the system is suspended, compare that against
the time(2) when the system is resumed, and use the delta between them
to decide which leases have expired.  Sadly, this cannot be done since
through at least Solaris 8, it is not possible for userland programs
to be notified of system suspend events.

Configuration
-------------

For the most part, the DHCP client only *retrieves* configuration data
from the DHCP server, leaving the configuration to scripts (such as
boot scripts), which themselves use dhcpinfo(1) to retrieve the data
from the DHCP client.  This is desirable because it keeps the mechanism
of retrieving the configuration data decoupled from the policy of using
the data.

However, unless used in "inform" mode, the DHCP client *does* configure
each interface enough to allow it to communicate with other hosts.
Specifically, the DHCP client configures the interface's IP address,
netmask, and broadcast address using the information provided by the
server.  Further, for physical interfaces, any provided default routes
are also configured.  Since logical interfaces cannot be stored in the
kernel routing table, and in most cases, logical interfaces share a
default route with their associated physical interface, the DHCP client
does not automatically add or remove default routes when leases are
acquired or expired on logical interfaces.

Event Scripting
---------------

The DHCP client supports user program invocations on DHCP events.  The
supported events are BOUND, EXTEND, EXPIRE, DROP and RELEASE.  The user
program runs asynchronous to the DHCP client so that the main event
loop stays active to process other events, including events triggered
by the user program (for example, when it invokes dhcpinfo).

The user program execution is part of the transaction of a DHCP command.
For example, if the user program is not enabled, the transaction of the
DHCP command START is considered over when an ACK is received and the
interface is configured successfully.  If the user program is enabled,
it is invoked after the interface is configured successfully, and the
transaction is considered over only when the user program exits.  The
event scripting implementation makes use of the asynchronous operations
discussed in the "Transactions" section.

The upper bound of 58 seconds is imposed on how long the user program
can run. If the user program does not exit after 55 seconds, the signal
SIGTERM is sent to it. If it still does not exit after additional 3
seconds, the signal SIGKILL is sent to it.  Since the event handler is
a wrapper around poll(), the DHCP client cannot directly observe the
completion of the user program.  Instead, the DHCP client creates a
child "helper" process to synchronously monitor the user program (this
process is also used to send the aformentioned signals to the process,
if necessary). The DHCP client and the helper process share a pipe
which is included in the set of poll descriptors monitored by the DHCP
client's event handler.  When the user program exits, the helper process
passes the user program exit status to the DHCP client through the pipe,
informing the DHCP client that the user program has finished.  When the
DHCP client is asked to shut down, it will wait for any running instances
of the user program to complete.
