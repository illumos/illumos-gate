Configuration files for syseventd(8).

These files are not intended to be edited and any changes made
will not be preserved across upgrades.

The format for file names in this directory is:

	<vendor>,[<publisher>,][<class>,[<subclass>,]]sysevent.conf

Files with a suffix other than ',sysevent.conf' are ignored.

After making a change to a file in this directory, restart the
syseventd daemon by issuing:

	pkill -HUP syseventd


The format for each line in a sysevent.conf file is:

	<class> <subclass> <vendor> <publisher> <user> <reserved1>
		<reserved2> <path> <arguments>

<class>, <subclass>, <vendor> or <publisher> may be "-" to
match any class, subclass, vendor or publisher, respectively.

<user> may be "-" for commands to be invoked as root, or a
valid user name.

<reserved1> and <reserved2> must be "-".

<path> must be the path of the command to be invoked in response
to the event, and must be executable by <user>.

<arguments> are optional, and may be any arbitrary arguments
for the command to be invoked.  Macros may be used to substitute
actual parameters from the matching event on the command line.
