#
#	This file is used by ttyname(3C) to minimize search time
#	during attempts to determine the name of a terminal device.
#
#	This is done by providing the names of directories which
#	are most likely to contain device entries for terminal
#	devices. These directories will be searched in the order
#	listed prior to an exhaustive search of the rest of /dev.
#
#	Each line contains the name of a directory (which must
#	begin with "/dev") and (optionally) a set of flags which
#	modify the criteria used to determine a match. By default,
#	an exact match requires that the major/minor device number
#	(the M flag), the file system identifier (the F flag), and
#	the inode number (the I flag) all match.  Normally, a partial
#	match on the major/minor device and the file system identifier
#	is accepted only after exhausting all entries under /dev.
#	By specifying only the M and F flags, an exact match will
#	be accepted regardless of the value of the inode number as
#	soon as it is found.  This is especially useful for cloned
#	devices, which generally will not match inode numbers.
#
#	For additional information see ttysrch(5).
#
# EXAMPLE:
#
#	/dev/slan	MF
#
#	This would improve performance for Starlan network connections
#	if all Starlan network clone device entries were contained
#	in the /dev/slan directory.
