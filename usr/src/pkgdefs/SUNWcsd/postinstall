#
# SUNWcsd postinstall configuration
#
# To address various limitations of the packaging system with respect to
# driver files, we provide a somewhat improved system within this script.
# Driver file entries which must be created on the target system because
# they are needed BEFORE drvconfig runs on the subsequent re-configuration
# boot are added to the $prototype_* variable definitions below.  This script
# processes these maps, creating driver nodes and symbolic links, and
# updating the software database as necessary.
#
# DO NOT add entries for drivers which are not needed before drvconfig runs
# DO NOT copy any of this code to any other package script, OS/Net or otherwise
# DO NOT hardcode minor numbers for clone drivers (use the driver name instead)
#
# The prototype_com, prototype_sparc, and prototype_i386 variables defined
# below each consist of five whitespace-delimited columns, defined as follows:
#
# 1. Device Type - The single character 'b' (for block device) or 'c' (for
# character device).  Used as an argument to installf(1M) and mknod(1M).
#
# 2. Device Path - Relative (should NOT begin with /) path to the device file
# to be created.  This base is interpreted relative to $BASEDIR (typically /a).
#
# 3. Driver Name - The name of the driver which should be used to determine
# the major number for the device file.  This name should match the name of
# a driver previously added to $BASEDIR/etc/name_to_major via add_drv.
#
# 4. Minor Number - The minor number for the device file.  If the minor number
# is a sequence of digits, this literal minor number is used as the argument
# to mknod(1M).  If it contains any non-digit characters, it is presumed to
# be the name of a driver, and the corresponding major number from the
# name_to_major file is substituted instead.  This is useful for clone entries.
#
# 5. Symbolic Link - The symlink to the device path which should be created.
# This field may be left blank if no symlink is needed; if multiple links to
# the same device are required, entries may be repeated with different links.
# The link should be a relative path to which $BASEDIR can be prepended.
#
# Following its creation, the driver entry is assigned permissions and
# ownership according to the first matching entry in $BASEDIR/etc/minor_perm.
# This script uses the same algorithm as drvconfig(1M) to match minor_perm
# entries.  If no matching minor_perm entry is found, mode 0600, owner "root",
# and group "sys" is assigned.
#
