#	This Makefile defines the build rules for the directory
#	uts/i86pc/i86hvm.
#
#	The following two-level ordering must be maintained in this file.
#	  Lines are sorted first in order of decreasing specificity based on
#	  the first directory component.  That is, i86pc rules come before
#	  intel rules come before common rules.
#
#	  Lines whose initial directory components are equal are sorted
#	  alphabetically by the remaining components.
