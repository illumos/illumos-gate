4.0.4 code drop from Intel on 1/30/2003
=======================================
  This version is used as the base for putback into both s10 and
  s9u4. 

  Following changes were done to this code base before putting
  back into solaris trees (S10 & S9U4):

  1) Changes to e1000_hw.c to remove build warnings

Bug fixes to 4.0.4:
===================
   1) bug#4829398 code cleanup for ethernet bootup messages


4.0.12 code drop from Intel on 3/18/2003
========================================

  This drop had extensive changes from 4.0.4. Many changes after 
  4.0.4 were realted to new hardware (a.k.a. BayCity chipset), 
  not relevant to Grizzly.After looking at the changelog from Intel, 
  we decided not to do a putback but rather take only high priority 
  fixes from this drop and generate a new version 4.0.4.1.

  Here is the changelog supplied by Intel for this drop:

    ________________________________________________________________________
    Component Name: Unix-Solaris_8254x_BayCity_Intel
    Description: Bay City software component for gigabit products
    ________________________________________________________________________


    ---Version: 4.0.13  Date: 3/14/2003 5:00:00 PM---
    Added transmit mutex locking to the 82547 workaround code.

    ---Version: 4.0.12  Date: 3/10/2003 8:01:00 PM---
    Added new shared code with LED link speed fix

    ---Version: 4.0.11  Date: 3/7/2003 5:57:00 PM---
    Updated the Tanacross FIFO hang workaround to reset FIFO pointers instead of sending autonomous packets.

    ---Version: 4.0.10  Date: 3/4/2003 2:39:00 PM---
    Removed an extra sdu adjustment that was left in by accident 

    ---Version: 4.0.9   Date: 3/4/2003 11:13:00 AM---
    Removed the first call to adapter_stop.  This was called before the HW struct was properly initialized, and could cause hangs. 

    Changed reported ethernet sdu from 2024 to 1500, as driver could be configured for invalid frame MTU sizes in Solaris 9.

    Added Tanacross workaround for FIFO hang.

    ---Version: 4.0.8   Date: 2/25/2003 2:27:00 PM---
    Shared code update including Phy init script.
    Smartspeed workaround added.  e1000g_smartspeed called from LocalTimer function every two seconds when link is down. 

    ---Version: 4.0.7   Date: 2/18/2003 11:41:00 AM---
    Updated to include bug fixes from the shared code.

    ---Version: 4.0.5   Date: 1/31/2003 10:13:00 AM---
    Support for new hardware changes
    Removed the extra ack sent at the end of the attach_req routine.  This extra ack previously made IPv6 plumbing on Solaris 9 fail. 


4.0.4.1 
=======
   This version is not an Intel drop but 4.0.4 merged with two
   high priority fixes from 4.0.12. We will give back the 4.0.4.1 
   driver back to Intel, per their request, so they have the exact 
   code that we are releasing through Solaris.

   The following are the two fixes selected for inclusion from
   4.0.12 codebase:

   1) Removing the first call to adapter_stop as discussed in
      4.0.12 changelog.

   2) Corrections to MTU size calculations first introduced
      in our 4.0.4 putback to bring them into sync with 4.0.12
      MTU size calculations.

   We also added README file (current file you are reading) during
   this putback.

4.0.4.2 
=======
  This version has the following fixes:

  1) bug#4857098: e1000g driver assumes another intel card as its own.
     The fix involved eliminating 1009, 1012, 1015, 1016, 1017 
     device-ids from e1000g nodelist so that they do not conflict 
     with iprb's subsystem-ids.

     This fix has to be reverted later once we have a proper fix for
     bug#4859426.

   2) bug#4853683: e1000g lacks a large number of expected kstats
      The fix involved three steps: a) Renaming some of the existing
      kstats to comply with WDD documentation b) Computing some of
      those which are not being tracked c) Supplying zero for the rest
      the error stats which are not being tracked.

      This fix has to be revisited to improvise the statistics in 
      future.
     
   3) bug#4862529: System panics during configuring devices on a Dell 4-way 
      servers. The fix involved removing all the devic-ids from nodelist
      except for 1010. This means that we support now only the grizzly 
      on-board gigabit chipset and "Intel Pro/1000 MT Dual Server Adapter". 
    
      This fix has to be reverted later once we have a proper fix for
      bug#4859426.

4.0.4.3 
=======
  This version has the following fixes:

  1) bug#4874857: ipv6 ping fails on bootup for e1000g.
	 The fix involved implementing multicast tables both at per stream
	 level and per device level.

  2) bug#4875743: null pointer dereference in ddi_dma_addr_bind_handle.
	 The fix involved adding LastTxDescriptorBuf to struct e1000g and
	 handling consequent proper calculations for LastTxDescriptor.

  3) bug#4882541: setting up ethernet address causes machine to panic.
     The fix involved removing a spurious log message which was causing
	 the panic.

  4) bug#4883302: Reinstate the removed device-ids - phase 2.
	 The fix involved some chip initializations to handle 1000 id.

  5) bug#4919285: device id 8086,100e needs to be added
	 The fix needed for the Intel Precision 350 workstation

4.2.11
======

We need to sync up with the latest Intel code base for e1000g driver.

Intel is currently at version 4.2.11 while we are on 4.0.4 branch.
The exact version under 4.0.4 branch is 4.0.4.3. Since we are on
the branch while Intel is working on the main trunk, we have had
lot of friction in getting timely fixes from Intel. The current
syncing up with their main trunk lets us a smooth migration path.

The new code base  also would provide us with support for additional
cards including Quad port cards (See bugs: 4921433, 4914460).
In our old 4.0.4 branch, we had to drop support for a lot of cards
for various problems; with the current syncing up, we would be able
to support so many various cards except for the cards clashing with
iprb driver.

The new code base also has support for additional new chipsets. The code
base also benefits from any fixes to the shared code base with other
operating system drivers.

The new codebase also has lot of cleanups in terms of various #ifdefs
and should be much simpler to maintain.

So the list of actual ids take out are:
1009
1012
1013
1015
1016
1017
