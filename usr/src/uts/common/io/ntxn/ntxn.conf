# Driver.conf file for Netxen 10-Gigabit Ethernet devices
# 
# All the properties below can be set globally (i.e. for all instances
# of ntxn), or on a per-instance basis.  See driver.conf(5) for details
# of the syntax of global and per-instance properties.
#
# Properties specified in this file take effect when the driver is first
# loaded, typically just after system boot.  Changes to the file will
# therefore not take effect until the next reboot, but will be permanent
# thereafter.
#
# Some of the driver's parameters can also be changed using ndd(8).
# Changes made with ndd apply only to a specific instance (e.g. ntxn0).
# They take effect immediately, but are lost if the driver is unloaded.
