# cr-delay: Sets the coalesce response delay in the adapter.
#
# This value specifies a count of milliseconds after which an interrupt 
# response is generated if cr-count has not been satisfied. This value is

#
# This is only valid if topology is loop. A zero setting means no preference.
# If multiple adapter instances on the same host are on the same loop, 
# you will want to set this value differently for each adapter.

# num-nodes:  Number of fibre channel nodes (NPorts) the driver will support.
# 
# 0 = Indicates auto detect limit of adapter.
#
# Range:  Min:0  Max:4096  Default:0
#
num-nodes=0;


# pci-max-read:  Sets the PCI-X max memory read byte count on the adapter.
#
# This value controls the adapter's max PCI-X memory read count.
# On Sunfire x4100/4200 systems this parameter must be changed to 
# 1024 bytes.  Currently, this parameter should only be modified on 
# Sunfire x4100/4200 systems due to the unique nature of the PCI-X bus 
# on these systems, otherwise it should be left as default.
#
# Options:  512, 1024, 2048, 4096
#
# Range:  Min:512  Max:4096  Default:2048
#
# *Uncomment this parameter for Sunfire x4100/4200 systems only
#pci-max-read=1024;


# linkup-delay:  Sets the linkup delay period (seconds) after initialization.
#
# This value controls how long the driver waits for the Fibre Channel 
# link to come up after an adapter reset before continuing normal operation.
#
# Range:  Min:0  Max:60  Default:10
#
linkup-delay=10;


# enable-npiv:  Enables NPIV support in the driver.
#
# Requires SLI3 mode support in the adapter firmware.
#
# Range:  Min:0  Max:1  Default:0
#
enable-npiv=0;


# vport-restrict-login:  Restricts login to virtual ports to conserve resources.
#
# Requires SLI3 mode support in the adapter firmware.
# Requires enable-npiv parameter to be set to 1.
#
# Range:  Min:0  Max:1  Default:1
#
vport-restrict-login=1;


# enable-auth:  Enables DHCHAP support in the driver.
#
# Range:  Min:0  Max:1  Default:0
#
enable-auth=0;


# target-mode:  Controls COMSTAR target mode support for an adapter port.
#
# 0 = Disables target mode support. Enables  initiator mode support.
# 1 = Enables  target mode support. Disables initiator mode support.
#
# Usage examples:
#     target-mode=1;          Sets global default for target mode
#     emlxs0-target-mode=0;   emlxs0 will be an initiator port
#     emlxs1-target-mode=1;   emlxs1 will be a target port
#
# Range:  Min:0  Max:1  Default:0
#
target-mode=0;


# ddi-forceattach:  Force driver attach during system boot.
#
# 0 = Disables forced driver attach during system boot. (Default)
# 1 = Enables forced driver attach during system boot.
#
# This parameter is required if you enable target-mode. 
# If target mode is enabled the emlxs driver MUST be force attached
# at system boot to ensure remote initiators will be able to
# discover it.
#
# Range:  Min:0  Max:1  Default:0
#
# *Uncomment this parameter when target-mode is enabled
#ddi-forceattach=1;
 

# fct-bufpool:  Controls buffer pool used by COMSTAR for FCP IOs
#               This should ONLY be used if target-mode is enabled
#             
#    Each entry consists of "Size:Count" where:
#    Size is the decimal size, in bytes, of this buffer pool
#    Count is the decimal number of buffers of this corresponding size
#    There can be at most 16 different types of entries
#
#    The default behavior for a target port is
#    fct-bufpool="512:256",
#                "8192:128",
#                "65536:64",
#                "131072:64";
#
# Usage examples:
#     fct-bufpool          Sets global default for buffer pool
#     emlxs0-fct-bufpool   Sets buffer pool for emlxs0
#     emlxs1-fct-bufpool   Sets buffer pool for emlxs1
#
 
 
# fct-queue-depth:  Controls the queue depth for a COMSTAR target port
#                   This should ONLY be used if target-mode is enabled
#
#    By default, the max number of simultaneous IOs a target port can handle
#    is equal to the HBA throttle. The HBA throttle varies by adapter model
#    but usually represents approximately 2000 simultaneous IOs.  With this 
#    parameter, the user can limit the number of simultaneous IOs to a 
#    smaller value.
#
# Usage examples:
#     fct-queue-depth=256;          Sets global default for a target port queue
#                                   depth to 256 IOs.
#     emlxs0-fct-queue-depth=256;   emlxs0 will limit its target queue depth to
#                                   256 IOs 
#


# ddi-forceload:  Allows the firmware module to be loaded early enough in the
#                 boot to be available for the emlxs root instance to use.
#                 This value should not be modified by the user.

ddi-forceload = "misc/emlxs/emlxs_fw";
