aac driver 2.0
================
The Solaris aac driver enhancement updates the Solaris aac 1.6 driver
to a full-fledged one. The old Solaris aac driver is simple and stable,
but with limited functions.

The new Solaris aac driver adds support of the following features:
1. New firmware support:
	New Communication interface, RawIO command, Large FIB, 64-bit LBA
2. New hardware support:
	Rocket chip based cards, such as 2820SA
3. Other features:
	64-bit DMA, Fast IO, firmware version checking, tagged-queuing
4. IOCTL
5. AIF
6. IOP reset

The new Solaris aac 2.0 driver is mainly based on FreeBSD 6.0 aac driver.
IOP reset, AIF handling, 64-bit LBA, and some other minor features are
implemented from scratch by Adaptec engineers. They are not supported in
current FreeBSD aac driver.

Adaptec approves Sun's intention to open source the aac RAID driver for
commercial Solaris and the Open Solaris community.

aac driver 2.1.14
===================
UART trace support is added in this release:
        The driver can now make output through the firmware UART trace. You
        have to set AAC_DEBUG and the appropriate flags in aac_debug_flags, at
        least AACDB_FLAGS_FW_PRINT to enable the UART trace and any other flags
	to enable the output class you want to see.
	To use the tip utility to connect to the UART daughter card, a configu-
	ration line as below should be added to /etc/remote:
	aac:\
		:dv=/dev/term/a:br#115200:el=^C^S^Q^U^D:ie=%$:oe=^D:

aac driver 2.2.0
==================
SPARC platform support is added in this release:
	To support SPARC, the driver is modified for DDI compliance. The driver
	now uses DDI compliant functions to access the device's IO and memory
	spaces for DMA transfers.

aac driver 2.2.23
==================
MSI interrupts supporting is added in this release:
	Instead of supporting fixed interrupt only, the driver added the MSI
	interrupt whenever the HBA card has this feature. In the same time, the
	driver has replaced all legacy interrupt ddi interfaces callings by 
	the according ddi_intr_* ones.
