# Configuration file for the audioixp audio driver.
#
#	WARNING: This is an UNSTABLE configuration file. Its contents
#		may change at any time.

# mixer-mode determines the mode the mixer audio personality module
# sets for this driver when it is loaded. The mixerctl(1) command may
# be used to change modes on the fly.
#
# The compat mode (mixer disabled) may not work as expected on all systems,
# please refer to the audioixp(7D) manpage. 
#
#       mixer-mode=1;   <-- mixer enabled
#       mixer-mode=0;   <-- mixer disabled, old audio(7I) behavior
#

mixer-mode=1;

#
# Uncomment cdrom to enable the audioixp driver to use the CDROM analog
# input. 
#
# cdrom=1;

#
# play-interrupts sets the number of interrupts per second when playing.
# This affects the resolution of various things, such as sample counts.
# record-interrupts does the same for record interrupts.
#
# These may be tuned to get more accurate information by increasing the
# count. However, the larger the interrupts per second the larger the
# load on the system. So use this capability cautiously. The audioixp
# driver enforces a maximum and minimum count.
#
# It should also be understood that not all interrupt rates are legal.
# The hardware is restricted to DMA buffers being allocated on certain
# boundaries. If those boundaries are violated the driver will not be
# loaded and an error message is entered into the messages log
#
play-interrupts=175;
record-interrupts=175;

#
# Uncomment reset-configuration to cause the audioixp driver's state to
# be reset to the default when the driver is loaded. Otherwise this state
# is retained across driver unload/reload cycles, but not across reboots.
#
#reset-configuration=1;
