This README describes the organization of the files and subdirectories
that make up the misc/mac module.

Changes to the sources should follow the layout and naming conventions
adopted herein.

Each functional component of the mac module is implemented in a separate
source file. The external interfaces are declared in header files delivered
under <sys>. The internal data structures and definitions are declared
in header files internal to this directory.

. Client Interface
    This is the kernel programming interface for accessing L2 services as
    a consumer.
	. mac_client.c
	. sys/mac_client.h:		APIs intended for external MAC consumers
	. sys/mac_client_priv.h:	APIs for GLDv3 components only (dld,
					dls, aggr, vnic, etc).
	. mac_client_impl.h		Internals.

. Provider Interface
    This is the GLDv3 kernel driver interface. Functions and data structures
    are used by L2 drivers to provide services to MAC consumers.
	. mac_provider.c
	. sys/mac_provider.h

. MAC Type Plugins
    The GLDv3 L2 supports multiple types of media control. Each type is
    implemented as a plugin delivered in a separate file under the
    plugin/ directory.
    Add a new file to the plugin/ directory for introducing a new MAC type.

. Core Component.
    - Scheduling Engine:
	. mac_datapath_setup.c:	Control path for the scheduler.
	. mac_soft_ring.c,
	  mac_soft_ring.h:	Fanout Soft Rings.
	. mac_sched.c:		Data path
	. mac_bcast.c		Data path and switching for broadcast and
				multicast packets.
	. mac_stat.c:		Statistics

    - Classification Engine
	mac_flow.c:		Flows and software classification:

    - NICs Resources Management
	. mac.c (this file also has other miscelanea)

. Misc
	. mac.c
	. mac_util.c
	. mac_ndd.c
