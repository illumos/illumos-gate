#
# -------------------- Link Configuration --------------------
# The parameters of link configuration:
#
# adv_autoneg_cap
#	Advertise capability of auto-negotiation.
#	Allowed values:	0, 1
#	Default value:	1
#
# adv_1000fdx_cap
#	Advertise capability of 1000Mbps full duplex
#	Allowed values:	0, 1
#	Default value:	1
#
# adv_100fdx_cap
#	Advertise capability of 100Mbps full duplex
#	Allowed values:	0, 1
#	Default value:	1
#
# adv_100hdx_cap
#	Advertise capability of 100Mbps half duplex
#	Allowed values:	0, 1
#	Default value:	1
#
# adv_10fdx_cap
#	Advertise capability of 10Mbps full duplex
#	Allowed values:	0, 1
#	Default value:	1
#
# adv_10hdx_cap
#	Advertise capability of 10Mbps half duplex
#	Allowed values:	0, 1
#	Default value:	1
#
# There are two methods to configure the link:
#	autonegotiation or forced link
#
# The parameter "adv_autoneg_cap" is used to enable autonegotiation or disable
# it (forced link mode).
#
# If autonegotiation is enabled (the default mode), all the "adv_*_cap"
# parameters control which capabilities are advertised to the partner. The
# default is to advertise all the capabilities that the hardware supports.
# The advertised capabilities can also be restricted to a subset. It is not
# possible to advertise a capability that the hardware does not support.
#
# The autonegotiation process will then automatically select the fastest speed/
# duplex mode supported by both partners.
#
# If autonegotiation is disabled (forced link mode), the link speed/duplex is
# determined by the first link capability that is enabled, in highest-to-lowest
# speed/duplex order.
#
# For example, if adv_1000fdx_cap is enabled, all other values will be ignored;
# to force 10hdx mode, all the faster modes must be explicitly disabled.
#
# Note:
# 1. 1000M half duplex is not supported with igb.
# 2. 1000M speed is not supported with the forced link mode (the value of
#    adv_1000fdx_cap will be ignored).
# 3. The forced link mode may result in a non-working link or a half duplex
#    link. If forced link mode is used, both the partners should be forced to
#    the same link/speed mode.
#
# adv_autoneg_cap	= 1;
# adv_1000fdx_cap	= 1;
# adv_100fdx_cap	= 1;
# adv_100hdx_cap	= 1;
# adv_10fdx_cap		= 1;
# adv_10hdx_cap		= 1;
#
# -------------------- Jumbo Frame --------------------
# default_mtu
#	The size of the default MTU (payload without the ethernet header)
#	Allowed values:	1500 - 9000
#	Default value:	1500
#
# default_mtu		= 1500;
#
# -------------------- Flow Control --------------------
# flow_control
#	Ethernet flow control
#	Allowed values:	0 - Disable
#			1 - Receive only
#			2 - Transmit only
#			3 - Receive and transmit
#			4 - Use NVROM-programmed factory default setting
#	default value:	3
#
# flow_control		= 3;
#
# -------------------- Transmit/Receive Queues --------------------
#
# tx_ring_size
#	The number of the transmit descriptors per transmit queue
#	Allowed values:	64 - 4096
#	Default value:	512
#
# rx_ring_size
#	The number of the receive descriptors per receive queue
#	Allowed values:	64 - 4096
#	Default value:	512
#
# mr_enable
#	Enable multiple rx queues and tx queues
#	Allowed values:	0, 1
#	Default value:	0
#
# rx_group_number
#	The number of the receive ring groups
#	Allowed values:	1 - 4
#	Default value:	1
#
# Note: If the specified values of the rx_group_number are not supported by
# hardware, the rx_group_number will be downgrade to an acceptable value.
#
# -------- How to set parameters for a particular interface ---------
# The example below shows how to locate the device path and set a parameter
# for a particular igb interface. (Using flow_control as an example)
#
# Use the following command to find out the device paths for igb,
#       more /etc/path_to_inst | grep igb
#
# For example, if you see,
#	"/pci@0,0/pci10de,5d@d/pci8086,0@0" 0 "igb"
#	"/pci@0,0/pci10de,5d@d/pci8086,0@0,1" 1 "igb"
#
# name = "pciex8086,10a7" parent = "/pci@0,0/pci10de,5d@d" unit-address = "0"
# flow_control = 1;
# name = "pciex8086,10a7" parent = "/pci@0,0/pci10de,5d@d" unit-address = "0,1"
# flow_control = 3;
