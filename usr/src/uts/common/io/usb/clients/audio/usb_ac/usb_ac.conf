# sets for this driver when it is loaded. The mixerctl(1) command may
# be used to change modes on the fly.

# Uncomment reset-configuration to cause the usb_ac driver's state to
# be reset to the default when the driver is loaded. Otherwise this state
# is retained across driver unload/reload cycles, but not across reboots.
