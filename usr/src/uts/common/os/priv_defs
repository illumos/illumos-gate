# add the new privilege at the end; for ordinary releases privileges
# should be ordered alphabetically.

	effective, permitted and inheritable sets; the limit set must
	be a superset of the target's limit set; if the target process

	of snapshots.
	Allows a process to mount and unmount filesystems which would
	otherwise be restricted (i.e., most filesystems except
	namefs).
	A process performing a mount operation needs to have
	appropriate access to the device being mounted (read-write for
	"rw" mounts, read for "ro" mounts).
	A process performing any of the aforementioned
	filesystem operations needs to have read/write/owner
	access to the mount point.
	Only regular files and directories can serve as mount points
	for processes which do not have all zone privileges asserted.
	Unless a process has all zone privileges, the mount(2)
	system call will force the "nosuid" and "restrict" options, the
	latter only for autofs mountpoints.
