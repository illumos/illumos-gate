 *
 * 1. General Concepts
 * -------------------
 *
 * 1.1 Overview
 * ------------
 * We divide the kernel address space into a number of logically distinct
 * pieces, or *arenas*: text, data, heap, stack, and so on.  Within these
 * arenas we often subdivide further; for example, we use heap addresses
 * not only for the kernel heap (kmem_alloc() space), but also for DVMA,
 * bp_mapin(), /dev/kmem, and even some device mappings like the TOD chip.
 * The kernel address space, therefore, is most accurately described as
 * a tree of arenas in which each node of the tree *imports* some subset
 * of its parent.  The virtual memory allocator manages these arenas and
 * supports their natural hierarchical structure.
 *
 * 1.2 Arenas
 * ----------
 * An arena is nothing more than a set of integers.  These integers most
 * commonly represent virtual addresses, but in fact they can represent
 * anything at all.  For example, we could use an arena containing the
 * integers minpid through maxpid to allocate process IDs.  vmem_create()
 * and vmem_destroy() create and destroy vmem arenas.  In order to
 * differentiate between arenas used for adresses and arenas used for
 * identifiers, the VMC_IDENTIFIER flag is passed to vmem_create().  This
 * prevents identifier exhaustion from being diagnosed as general memory
 * failure.
 *
 * 1.3 Spans
 * ---------
 * We represent the integers in an arena as a collection of *spans*, or
 * contiguous ranges of integers.  For example, the kernel heap consists
 * of just one span: [kernelheap, ekernelheap).  Spans can be added to an
 * arena in two ways: explicitly, by vmem_add(), or implicitly, by
 * importing, as described in Section 1.5 below.
 *
 * 1.4 Segments
 * ------------
 * Spans are subdivided into *segments*, each of which is either allocated
 * or free.  A segment, like a span, is a contiguous range of integers.
 * Each allocated segment [addr, addr + size) represents exactly one
 * vmem_alloc(size) that returned addr.  Free segments represent the space
 * between allocated segments.  If two free segments are adjacent, we
 * coalesce them into one larger segment; that is, if segments [a, b) and
 * [b, c) are both free, we merge them into a single segment [a, c).
 * The segments within a span are linked together in increasing-address order
 * so we can easily determine whether coalescing is possible.
 *
 * Segments never cross span boundaries.  When all segments within
 * an imported span become free, we return the span to its source.
 *
 * 1.5 Imported Memory
 * -------------------
 * As mentioned in the overview, some arenas are logical subsets of
 * other arenas.  For example, kmem_va_arena (a virtual address cache
 * that satisfies most kmem_slab_create() requests) is just a subset
 * of heap_arena (the kernel heap) that provides caching for the most
 * common slab sizes.  When kmem_va_arena runs out of virtual memory,
 * it *imports* more from the heap; we say that heap_arena is the
 * *vmem source* for kmem_va_arena.  vmem_create() allows you to
 * specify any existing vmem arena as the source for your new arena.
 * Topologically, since every arena is a child of at most one source,
 * the set of all arenas forms a collection of trees.
 *
 * 1.6 Constrained Allocations
 * ---------------------------
 * Some vmem clients are quite picky about the kind of address they want.
 * For example, the DVMA code may need an address that is at a particular
 * phase with respect to some alignment (to get good cache coloring), or
 * that lies within certain limits (the addressable range of a device),
 * or that doesn't cross some boundary (a DMA counter restriction) --
 * or all of the above.  vmem_xalloc() allows the client to specify any
 * or all of these constraints.
 *
 * 1.7 The Vmem Quantum
 * --------------------
 * Every arena has a notion of 'quantum', specified at vmem_create() time,
 * that defines the arena's minimum unit of currency.  Most commonly the
 * quantum is either 1 or PAGESIZE, but any power of 2 is legal.
 * All vmem allocations are guaranteed to be quantum-aligned.
 *
 * 1.8 Quantum Caching
 * -------------------
 * A vmem arena may be so hot (frequently used) that the scalability of vmem
 * allocation is a significant concern.  We address this by allowing the most
 * common allocation sizes to be serviced by the kernel memory allocator,
 * which provides low-latency per-cpu caching.  The qcache_max argument to
 * vmem_create() specifies the largest allocation size to cache.
 *
 * 1.9 Relationship to Kernel Memory Allocator
 * -------------------------------------------
 * Every kmem cache has a vmem arena as its slab supplier.  The kernel memory
 * allocator uses vmem_alloc() and vmem_free() to create and destroy slabs.
 *
 *
 * 2. Implementation
 * -----------------
 *
 * 2.1 Segment lists and markers
 * -----------------------------
 * The segment structure (vmem_seg_t) contains two doubly-linked lists.
 *
 * The arena list (vs_anext/vs_aprev) links all segments in the arena.
 * In addition to the allocated and free segments, the arena contains
 * special marker segments at span boundaries.  Span markers simplify
 * coalescing and importing logic by making it easy to tell both when
 * we're at a span boundary (so we don't coalesce across it), and when
 * a span is completely free (its neighbors will both be span markers).
 *
 * Imported spans will have vs_import set.
 *
 * The next-of-kin list (vs_knext/vs_kprev) links segments of the same type:
 * (1) for allocated segments, vs_knext is the hash chain linkage;
 * (2) for free segments, vs_knext is the freelist linkage;
 * (3) for span marker segments, vs_knext is the next span marker.
 *
 * 2.2 Allocation hashing
 * ----------------------
 * We maintain a hash table of all allocated segments, hashed by address.
 * This allows vmem_free() to discover the target segment in constant time.
 * vmem_update() periodically resizes hash tables to keep hash chains short.
 *
 * 2.3 Freelist management
 * -----------------------
 * We maintain power-of-2 freelists for free segments, i.e. free segments
 * of size >= 2^n reside in vmp->vm_freelist[n].  To ensure constant-time
 * allocation, vmem_xalloc() looks not in the first freelist that *might*
 * satisfy the allocation, but in the first freelist that *definitely*
 * satisfies the allocation (unless VM_BESTFIT is specified, or all larger
 * freelists are empty).  For example, a 1000-byte allocation will be
 * satisfied not from the 512..1023-byte freelist, whose members *might*
 * contains a 1000-byte segment, but from a 1024-byte or larger freelist,
 * the first member of which will *definitely* satisfy the allocation.
 * This ensures that vmem_xalloc() works in constant time.
 *
 * We maintain a bit map to determine quickly which freelists are non-empty.
 * vmp->vm_freemap & (1 << n) is non-zero iff vmp->vm_freelist[n] is non-empty.
 *
 * The different freelists are linked together into one large freelist,
 * with the freelist heads serving as markers.  Freelist markers simplify
 * the maintenance of vm_freemap by making it easy to tell when we're taking
 * the last member of a freelist (both of its neighbors will be markers).
 *
 * 2.4 Vmem Locking
 * ----------------
 * For simplicity, all arena state is protected by a per-arena lock.
 * For very hot arenas, use quantum caching for scalability.
 *
 * 2.5 Vmem Population
 * -------------------
 * Any internal vmem routine that might need to allocate new segment
 * structures must prepare in advance by calling vmem_populate(), which
 * will preallocate enough vmem_seg_t's to get is through the entire
 * operation without dropping the arena lock.
 *
 * 2.6 Auditing
 * ------------
 * If KMF_AUDIT is set in kmem_flags, we audit vmem allocations as well.
 * Since virtual addresses cannot be scribbled on, there is no equivalent
 * in vmem to redzone checking, deadbeef, or other kmem debugging features.
 * Moreover, we do not audit frees because segment coalescing destroys the
 * association between an address and its segment structure.  Auditing is
 * thus intended primarily to keep track of who's consuming the arena.
 * Debugging support could certainly be extended in the future if it proves
 * necessary, but we do so much live checking via the allocation hash table
 * that even non-DEBUG systems get quite a bit of sanity checking already.

 * The segment structures themselves are allocated from vmem_seg_arena, so
 * we have a recursion problem when vmem_seg_arena needs to populate itself.
 * We address this by working out the maximum number of segment structures
 * this act will require, and multiplying by the maximum number of threads
 * that we'll allow to do it simultaneously.
 *
 * The worst-case segment consumption to populate vmem_seg_arena is as
 * follows (depicted as a stack trace to indicate why events are occurring):
 *
 * (In order to lower the fragmentation in the heap_arena, we specify a
 * minimum import size for the vmem_metadata_arena which is the same size
 * as the kmem_va quantum cache allocations.  This causes the worst-case
 * allocation from the vmem_metadata_arena to be 3 segments.)
 *
 * vmem_alloc(vmem_seg_arena)		-> 2 segs (span create + exact alloc)
 *  segkmem_alloc(vmem_metadata_arena)
 *   vmem_alloc(vmem_metadata_arena)	-> 3 segs (span create + left alloc)
 *    vmem_alloc(heap_arena)		-> 1 seg (left alloc)
 *   page_create()
 *   hat_memload()
 *    kmem_cache_alloc()
 *     kmem_slab_create()
 *	vmem_alloc(hat_memload_arena)	-> 2 segs (span create + exact alloc)
 *	 segkmem_alloc(heap_arena)
 *	  vmem_alloc(heap_arena)	-> 1 seg (left alloc)
 *	  page_create()
 *	  hat_memload()		-> (hat layer won't recurse further)
 *
 * The worst-case consumption for each arena is 3 segment structures.
 * Of course, a 3-seg reserve could easily be blown by multiple threads.
 * Therefore, we serialize all allocations from vmem_seg_arena (which is OK
 * because they're rare).  We cannot allow a non-blocking allocation to get
 * tied up behind a blocking allocation, however, so we use separate locks
 * for VM_SLEEP and VM_NOSLEEP allocations.  Similarly, VM_PUSHPAGE allocations
 * must not block behind ordinary VM_SLEEPs.  In addition, if the system is
 * panicking then we must keep enough resources for panic_thread to do its
 * work.  Thus we have at most four threads trying to allocate from
 * vmem_seg_arena, and each thread consumes at most three segment structures,
 * so we must maintain a 12-seg reserve.
