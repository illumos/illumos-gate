 * CPUID Emulation
 *
 * All CPUID instruction exits are handled by the in-kernel emulation.
 *
 * ----------------
 * Legacy Emulation
 * ----------------
 *
 * Originally, the kernel vmm portion of bhyve relied on fixed logic to filter
 * and/or generate CPUID results based on what was reported by the host CPU, as
 * well as attributes of the VM (such as CPU topology, and enabled features).
 * This is largely adequate to expose CPU capabilities to the guest in manner
 * which allows it to operate properly.
 *
 * ------------------------------
 * Userspace-Controlled Emulation
 * ------------------------------
 *
 * In certain situations, more control over the CPUID emulation results present
 * to the guest is desired.  Live migration between physical hosts is one such
 * example, where the underlying CPUs, or at least their microcode, may differ
 * between the source and destination.  In such cases, where changes to the
 * CPUID results cannot be tolerated, the userspace portion of the VMM can be in
 * complete control over the leaves which are presented to the guest.  It may
 * still consult the "legacy" CPUID data for guidance about which CPU features
 * are safe to expose (due to hypervisor limitations, etc).  This leaf
 * information is configured on a per-vCPU basis.
 *
 * The emulation entries provided by userspace are expected to be in sorted
 * order, running from lowest function and index to highest.
 *
 * For example:
 * (func: 00h idx: 00h) ->
 *     (flags: 0, eax: highest std leaf, ebx-edx: vendor id)
 * (func: 0Dh idx: 00h) ->
 *     (flags: VCE_FLAG_MATCH_INDEX, eax - edx: XCR0/XSAVE info)
 * (func: 0Dh idx: 01h) ->
 *     (flags: VCE_FLAG_MATCH_INDEX, eax - edx: XSAVE/XSAVEOPT details)
 *     ...
 * (func: 0Dh idx: 07H) ->
 *     (flags: VCE_FLAG_MATCH_INDEX, eax - edx: AVX-512 details)
 * (func: 8000000h idx: 0h) ->
 *     (flags: 0, eax: highest extd leaf ...)
 *     ...
