# Certain hardware RAID controllers have nonvolatile caches but do not
# support the SYNC_NV bit to restrict flushes to the volatile portion of
# the cache, if any.  In order to get acceptable performance out of these
# devices, we need to suppress cache flushing on them.  In most (hopefully
# all) cases, if the battery fails or the cache otherwise becomes volatile,
# the controller will switch to write-through mode, and ensure that any
# underlying drive cache is off.  In this case, it should still be safe to
# dispense with cache flush commands.  Controllers for which this is not the
# case should have cache-nonvolatile set unless data loss and corruption are
# acceptable.
#
# In addition, *all* devices have their retries capped at 1.  There are an
# additional 2 retries for "victim" IOs if a reset is needed.  Retrying is
# very rarely successful, and it is preferable to let ZFS do it where needed.
#
# For the Samsung client drives, users have seen data corruption when they use
# the advertised 512 byte sectors. The actual sector size of the flash
# translation layer is 4K, so it's relatively safe to make this change which
# annecdotally solves that problem.
