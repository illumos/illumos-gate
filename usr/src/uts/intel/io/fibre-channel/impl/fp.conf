# Automatic configuration of the fabric is turned on by default
# and thus allows all devices discovered in the SAN zone to be
# enumerated in the Solaris devinfo tree automatically.
#
# The manual_configuration_only property may be used to
# disable default behavior and force the manual configuration of
# the devices in the SAN. Setting manual_configuration_only=1
# will disable the automatic configuration of devices.
# NOTE: Use of this property is not recommended. If used, the
# fabric devices accessed at boot time need to get manually configured
# before the next reboot. Otherwise, fabric devices that are needed at
# boot time may not get configured and may cause boot problems.
# To manually configure fabric devices, refer to cfgadm_fp(8).

# You can also enable or disable MPxIO on a per port basis.
