 * This is the etherboot intel etherexpress Pro/100B driver.
 *
 * It was written from scratch, with Donald Beckers eepro100.c kernel
 * driver as a guideline. Mostly the 82557 related definitions and the
 * lower level routines have been cut-and-pasted into this source.
 *
 * The driver was finished before Intel got the NDA out of the closet.
 * I still don't have the docs.
 * */

/* Philosophy of this driver.
 *
 * Probing:
 *
 * Using the pci.c functions of the Etherboot code, the 82557 chip is detected.
 * It is verified that the BIOS initialized everything properly and if
 * something is missing it is done now.
 *
 *
 * Initialization:
 *
 *
 * The chip is then initialized to "know" its ethernet address, and to
 * start recieving packets. The Linux driver has a whole transmit and
 * recieve ring of buffers. This is neat if you need high performance:
 * you can write the buffers asynchronously to the chip reading the
 * buffers and transmitting them over the network.  Performance is NOT
 * an issue here. We can boot a 400k kernel in about two
 * seconds. (Theory: 0.4 seconds). Booting a system is going to take
 * about half a minute anyway, so getting 10 times closer to the
 * theoretical limit is going to make a difference of a few percent.
 *
 *
 * Transmitting and recieving.
 *
 * We have only one transmit descriptor. It has two buffer descriptors:
 * one for the header, and the other for the data.
 * We have only one receive buffer. The chip is told to recieve packets,
 * and suspend itself once it got one. The recieve (poll) routine simply
 * looks at the recieve buffer to see if there is already a packet there.
 * if there is, the buffer is copied, and the reciever is restarted.
 *
 * Caveats:
 *
 * The Etherboot framework moves the code to the 48k segment from
 * 0x94000 to 0xa0000. There is just a little room between the end of
 * this driver and the 0xa0000 address. If you compile in too many
 * features, this will overflow.
 * The number under "hex" in the output of size that scrolls by while
 * compiling should be less than 8000. Maybe even the stack is up there,
 * so that you need even more headroom.
 */
