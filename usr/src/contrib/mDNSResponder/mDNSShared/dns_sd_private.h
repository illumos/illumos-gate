 *                  the reference (via DNSServiceRefDeallocate()) severs the

 *
 * pid :            Process ID of the delegate
 *
 * uuid:            UUID of the delegate
 *
 *                  Note that only one of the two arguments (pid or uuid) can be specified. If pid
 *                  is zero, uuid will be assumed to be a valid value; otherwise pid will be used.
 *
 * return value:    Returns kDNSServiceErr_NoError on success, otherwise returns
 *                  an error code indicating the specific failure that occurred (in which
 *                  case the DNSServiceRef is not initialized). kDNSServiceErr_NotAuth is
 *                  returned to indicate that the calling process does not have entitlements
 *                  to use this API.
