astsa implements a small subset of the ast library for other ast
standalone commands and libraries using X/Open interfaces. 

To get better performance and functionality, consider using any of
the full-featured ast-* packages at

	http://www.research.att.com/sw/download/

astsa.omk is an old make makefile that builds the headers and objects
and defines these variables for use in other makefiles

	ASTSA_OPTIMIZE	``-O'' by default

The astsa files may be combined in a single directory with other ast
standalone packages.
