	  is on, as you type a line beginning with a # the following characters
	  are treated as a shell pattern and cause matching lines from the
	  history file to be displayed as a numbered list as you type.

	  to make this the current line (n defaults to 1 of omitted) or
	  <ESC>n<cr> to execute.

	  executed by pfksh instead of being treated as built-ins.
10-03-16  A bug in whence -a which produced duplicate lines of output has
	  been fixed.
10-03-16  A bug in the handling of process groups in monitor mode for

	  running background job completes. (2) SIGCHLD traps are queued
	  so that each completing background job gets its own trap; $! is
	  set to the job pid and $? is set to the job exit status at the

	  for a variable with the -RZ attribute if the variable name had been
	  passed to a function has been fixed.
07-08-02  A bug in which read x[1] could core dump has been fixed.
07-08-02  A second bug in which after read x[sub] into an associative array
	  of an element that hasn't been assigned could lead to a core dump
	  has been fixed.
07-07-31  A bug in which a pipeline that completed correctly could have
	  an exit status of 127 when pipefail was enabled has been fixed.
07-07-09 +The SHOPT_AUDIT compile option has been added for keyboard logging.
07-06-25  In vi insert mode, ksh no longer emits a backspace character
	  before the carriage return when the newline is entered. 
07-06-25  A bug in which pipefail would cause a command to return 0
	  when the pipeline was the last command and the failure happened
	  on a component other than the last has been fixed.
07-06-25  A bug in the expansion of ${var/pattern/rep} when pattern or rep
	  contained a left parenthesis in single quotes has been fixed.
07-06-18  The braces for a subscripted variable with ${var[sub]} are now
	  optional when inside [[...]], ((...)) or as a subscript.
07-05-28  A bug in brace expansion in which single and double quotes did
          not treat the comma as a literal character has been fixed.

	  hang when the pipefail option is on has been fixed.
07-04-30 +Added -q to whence.
07-04-18  A small memory leak with each redirection of a non-builtin has
	  been fixed.
07-03-08  A bug in which set +o output command line options has been fixed.
07-03-08  A bug in which an error in read (for example, an invalid variable
	  name), could leave the terminal in raw mode has been fixed.

	  variable with a subscript that is an arithmetic expression has
	  been fixed.
07-03-06  Several serious bugs with the restricted shell were reported and
	  fixed.
07-03-02  If a job is stopped, and subsequently restarted with a CONT

	  systems that provide getaddrinfo(3).
06-12-19 +A -v option was added to read.  With this option the value of
	  the first variable name argument will become the default value
	  when read from a terminal device. 
06-11-20  A bug in which "${foo[@]:1}}" expands a null argument (instead of
	  no argument), when foo[0] is not empty has been fixed. 
06-11-16  The discipline functions have been modified to allow each subscript
	  to act independently.  Currently the discipline function will not
	  be called when called from a discipline function of the same variable.

	  an internal file was closed from with a subshell has been fixed.
06-10-30 +The redirections <# pattern, and <## pattern have been added.
	  Both seek forward to the beginning of the next line that contains

	  output.
06-10-26 +On systems that support stream control transport, the virtual file
	  name /dev/sctp/host/port can now be used to establish connections.

	  with a single letter suffix added.  The modifier # when used with
	  the i specification provides units of 1024 with a two letter suffix.
06-10-24  The value of $! is now set to the process id of a job put
	  into the background with the bg command as required by POSIX.
06-10-23  A bug in which the value of $! was affected by a background
	  job started from a subshell has been fixed.

	  cause the builtin to hang has been fixed.
06-10-03  A bug in the for loop optimizer which causes >(...) process
	  substitution to be ignored has been fixed.
06-09-17 +The -a option was added to typeset for indexed arrays.  This
	  is only needed when using the ([subscript]=value ...) form.
06-09-06 +The showme option was added.  Each simple command not beginning
	  with a redirection and not occurring with in the while, until, if,
	  select condition can be preceded by a semi-colon which will
	  be ignored when showme is off.  When showme is on, any command
	  preceded by a colon will be traced but not executed.
06-08-16 +As a new feature, a leading ~(N) on a pattern has no effect 
	  except when used for file expansion.  In this case if not
	  matches are found, the pattern is replaced by nothing rather
	  than itself.
06-08-11  A bug in the expansion of ${.sh.match[i]:${#.shmatch[i]}} has
	  been fixed.
06-08-10 +The read builtin options -n and -N have been modified to treat
          the size as characters rather than bytes unless storing into a
	  binary (typeset -B) variable.
06-07-27 +When the here document operator << is followed directly by a #
	  rather than a -, the first line of the here-document determines
	  how much whitespace is removed for each line.
06-07-26  A bug in the C-shell history (enabled with set -H) in which the
	  history event !$ was not processed has been fixed.
06-07-21  A bug on some systems in which assigning PATH on a command line
	  would not take effect has been fixed.

	  and floating functions with invalid arguments yield NaN. 
06-06-20 +The floating point constants Inf and NaN can be used in arithmetic
	  expressions.
06-06-20 +The functions isinf(), isnan(), tanhl() have been added for
	  arithmetic expressions.
06-06-13  Internal change to use ordering for variables instead of hashing
	  to speed up prefix matching.
06-06-13  A window between fork/exec in which a signal could get lost
	  and cause a program to hang has been eliminated
06-06-13  A bug in edit completion with quoted strings has been fixed.
06-06-07  The restricted options can now be enabled by set as well as on
	  the command line.  Once set, it can not be disabled.
06-06-04  Modified built-in binding so that for systems for which /bin
          and /usr/bin are the same, a builtin bound to /bin will get
	  selected when either /bin or /usr/bin is scanned.
06-06-04 +Added literal-next character processing for emacs/gmacs mode. 
	  This change is not compatible with earlier versions of ksh93
          and ksh88 when the stty lnext is control-v.  The sequence
	  escape-control-v will display the shell version.
06-05-31 +Modified emacs and vi mode so that entering a TAB after a partial
	  TAB completion, generates a listing of possible completions.
	  After the second TAB, a number followed by a TAB will perform
	  the completion with the corresponding item.
06-05-19 +Modified arithmetic so that conversions to strings default to
	  the maximum number of precision digits.
06-05-16  Bug fixes for multibyte locales. 
06-05-10  The =~ operator was added to [[...]] and  [[ string ~= ERE ]]
	  is equivalent to [[ string == ~(E)ERE ]].
06-04-25  A bug in the vi edit mode which could cause the shell to core dump
	  when switching from emacs mode.
06-04-17  A bug in which using LANG or LC_ in assignment lists with builtins
	  did not restore the localed correctly has been fixed.
06-04-04  A bug in which discipline functions could not be added to variables
	  whose names started with .sh has been fixed.
06-03-28 +The -s option to typeset was added to modify -i to indicate short
	  integers.
06-03-28  A bug in which variables assignment lists before functions
	  defined with function name were not passed on the functions
	  invoked by this function has been fixed. 
06-03-28  A bug in which name references defined within a function defined
	  with function  name could not be used with compound variables has
	  been fixed.
06-03-27  A bug in which read <&p (print >&p) would cause the coprocess input
	  (output) pipe to close before reading from (after writing to)
          it has been fixed.
06-02-28  A bug in which stopping a job created with the hist builtin command
	  would create a job that could not be restarted has been fixed.  

06-01-24  --- Release ksh93r  ---
06-01-24  A bug in which running commands with standard output closed would
	  not work as expected has been fixed.

	  variable were array elements, i.e. foo=(bar=(1 2)), has been fixed.
05-12-13  An arithmetic bug in which x+=y+=z was not working has been fixed. 
05-12-13  An arithmetic bug in which x||y was returning x when x was non-zero
	  rather than 1 has been fixed.
05-12-07 +The aliases for integer and float have been changed to use attributes
	  -li and -lE to handle long long and long double types.
05-12-07 +The histexpand (-H) option has been added which allows C-shell
	  style history expansions using the history character !.
05-12-07 +The multiline option was added which changes that way the edit
	  modes handle lines longer than the window width.  Instead of
	  horizontal scrolling, multiple lines on the screen are used.
05-12-05  The whence builtin now returns an absolute pathname when the
          command is found in the current directory.
05-11-29  A bug which caused ksh -c '[[ ! ((' to core dump rather than
	  report a syntax error has been fixed.
05-11-29  A bug when reading fixed length records into typeset -b variables
	  which caused a zero byte to terminate the value has been fixed.
05-11-22 +The ability to seek to an offset within a file has been added
	  with the new I/O redirection operators, <#  and >#.  Currently,
	  these redirection operators must be followed by ((expr))
	  but in a future release, it should be able to used to seek forward
	  to the specified shell pattern.  In addition $(n<#) expands to the
	  current byte offset for file descriptor n.
05-11-22 +The .sh.match array variable is now set after each [[ ... ]]
	  pattern match.  Previously it was only set for substring matches.
05-10-17  A bug in which the library path variable could be prefixed
          with a directory when a .path file was not encountered in
	  the directory of the executable has been fixed.
05-09-15  A for/while loop optimizer bug in which $OPTIND was not
	  correctly expanded has been fixed.
05-09-05  A bug in which a history command that invoked a history
	  command could go into an infinite loop has been fixed.
05-08-31 +In the case that IFS contains to adjacent new-lines so that
	  new-line is not treated as a space delimiter, only a single
	  new-line is deleted at the end of a command substitution.
05-08-19 +When a tilde substitution expands to the / directory and is
	  followed by a /, it is replaced by the empty string.
05-08-16  A bug in which n<&m did not synchronize m has been fixed.
05-08-16  A bug in which process substitution  ( <() and >() ) was not
	  working within for and while loops has been fixed.
05-07-24  A bug in which the pattern ~(E)(foo|bar) was treated as a syntax
	  error has been fixed.
05-07-24  A bug in completion with <n>=, where n was the one of the
	  previous selection choices has been fixed.
05-07-21  A bug with multibyte input when no edit mode was specified which
	  caused the input line to shift left/right has been fixed.
05-06-24  A race condition which could cause the exit status to get lost
	  on some fast systems has been fixed.
05-06-21  A bug in which nested patterns of the form {m,n}(pat) would cause
	  syntax errors has been fixed.
05-06-21  A bug in the macro expander has been fixed which could cause a
          syntax error for an expansion of the form ${x-$(...)} when
	  x is set and the command substitution contained certain strings.
05-06-08 +On systems for which echo does not do System V style \ expansions,
	  the -e option was added to enable these expansion.
05-06-08  A bug in which ${var op pattern} to not work when inside an
	  arithmetic expression has been fixed.
05-05-23 +An extension to shell patterns that allows matching of nested
	  groups while skipping over quoted strings has been added.

          functions loaded from FPATH has been fixed.
05-04-18  A bug in which the exit status $? is not set when a trap triggered
	  by the [[...]] command is executed has been fixed.
05-04-08 +Redirection operators can be directly preceded with {varname}
	  with no intervening space, where varname is a variable name which
	  allows the shell to select a file descriptor > 10 and store it
	  into varname.
05-04-08 +SHOPT_CMDLIB_BLTIN=1 now includes <cmdlist.h> generated table.
05-04-07 +[[ -o ?option ]] is true if "option" is a supported option.
05-04-05  A bug in handling file completion with spaces in the names
          has been fixed.
05-03-25 +The SIGWINCH signal is caught by default to keeps the LINES and
	  COLUMNS variables in sync with the actual window size.
05-03-25 +Building ksh with SHOPT_REMOTE=1 causes ksh to set --rc if stdin is
	  a socket (presumably part of a remote shell invocation.)
05-03-25 +Building ksh with SHOPT_SYSRC=1 causes interactive ksh to source
	  /etc/ksh.kshrc (if it exists) before sourcing the $ENV file.
05-03-25 +{first..last[..incr][%fmt]} sequences added to brace expansions
	  when braceexpand is enabled.

	  keep a file descriptor open which could cause a foreground
	  process to hang has been fixed.
05-02-24  A bug where builtin library commands (e.g., date and TZ) failed to
	  detect environment variable changes has been fixed.
05-02-22 +The read builtin and word splitting are now consistent with respect
	  to IFS -- both treat IFS as field delimiters.
05-02-22 +The read builtin no longer strips off trailing delimiters that
	  are not space characters when there are fewer variables than fields.
05-02-17  A builtin bug on systems where dlsym(libcmd) returns link-time
	  bindings has been fixed.
05-02-12  A bug in which the lib_init() function for .paths BUILTIN_LIB
	  libraries was not called has been fixed.
05-02-06  A bug on some systems in which moving the write end of a co-process
	  to a numbered file descriptor could cause it to close has been fixed.

05-01-11  An argument parsing bug that caused `kill -s x -- n' to fail has
	  been fixed.
05-01-11 +The .paths file, introduced in ksh93m, which can appear in
	  any directory in PATH, now allows a line of the form 'BUILTIN_LIB=.'
	  When a command is searched for this directory, and the full path
	  matches the path of the built-in version of the command (listed
	  by the 'builtin' command) then the built-in version of the command
	  is used.  When ksh is built with SHOPT_CMDLIB_DIR=1 then all libcmd
	  functions become builtins with the '/opt/ast/bin/' directory prefix.
05-01-10  A bug in which a nameref to a compound name caused a core dump has
	  been fixed.
05-01-09  A bug in which some SIGCHLD interrupts (from child processes exiting)
	  caused a fatal print/echo error diagnostic has been fixed.

	  to /dev/stderr has been fixed.
04-11-17  A bug in which an expansion of the form ${array[@]:3} could expand
          to ${array[0]} when ${array[3]} was not set has been fixed.
04-10-22 +The -E or -orc command line option reads ${ENV-$HOME/.kshrc} file.
04-10-22 +`-o foo' equivalent to `+o nofoo', `-o nobar' equivalent to `+o bar'.
          `--foo' equivalent to `-o foo', `--nofoo' equivalent to `+o foo'
04-10-05 +The .paths file, introduced in ksh93m, which can appear in
	  any directory in PATH, now allows a line of the form
	  'BUILTIN_LIB=libname'.  When a command is searched for this directory,
	  the shared library named by libname will first be searched for a
	  built-in version of the command.
04-09-03  <<< here documents now handle quotes in the word token correctly. 
04-08-08 +The maximum size for read -n and and read -N was increased from
	  4095 to 32M.
04-08-04 +printf %q was modified so that if an no operand was supplied, no
	  no output would be generated rather than a quoted empty string.
04-08-01 +The -n and -N options of the read builtin has been modified
	  when reading variables with the binary attribute so that the
	  data is stored directly rather than through assignment.
04-08-01 +The shcomp command has been modified to process alias commands
	  under some conditions.
04-07-31 +The .sh.match variable added in ksh93l, now works like other
	  indexed arrays.
04-07-08  A loop optimizer bug which occurs when typeset is used in
	  a for or while loop inside a function has been fixed.
04-06-24 +The number of subexpressions in a pattern was increased to 64
	  from the current number of 20.
04-06-17 +The -t option to read was modified to allow seconds to be
	  specified as any arithmetic expression rather than just
	  an integral number of seconds, for example even -t 'sin(.5)'
	  is now valid.
04-06-16  Two small memory leak problems were fixed.
04-06-15  A bug in ${var/pattern/"string"} which occurred when string
	  contained pattern matching characters has been fixed.
04-05-08  printf $'%d\n' produced an erroneous error message and has
	  been fixed.
04-05-24  A bug in which an associative array without any elements could
	  cause a core dump when a script with an associative array with
	  the same name was declared in a script invoked by name has
	  been fixed.
04-05-11  A bug in which an exec statement could close the script that
	  is being processed in a script that is run by name causing
	  a failure has been fixed.
04-04-28 +If the first character of assignment to an integer variable was 0,
          the variable had been treated as unsigned.  This behavior was
          undocumented and has been removed.
04-04-05  A bug in which the positioning of standard input could be incorrect
	  after reading from standard input from a subshell has been fixed.
04-03-30  A bug in the for loop optimizer which in rare cases could cause
	  memory corruption has been fixed.
04-03-29 +The preset alias source='command .' has been added.
04-03-29  A bug introduced in ksh93p on some systems in which invoked by
	  name with #! on the first line would not get the signals handling
	  initialized correctly has been fixed. 
04-03-29  A bug introduced in ksh93p in which a HUP signal received by
	  a shell that is a session group leader was not passed down to
	  its children has been fixed.

04-02-28  --- Release ksh93p  ---
04-02-28 +The ability to apply an append discipline to any variable has
	  been added.
04-02-14  A bug in which the exportall option (set -a) would cause incorrect
	  results for arrays has been fixed.
04-02-02  A bug in which an exported array would pass more than
	  the first element to a script invoked by name has been fixed.
04-02-02  A bug on some systems in which name=value pairs preceding a script
	  invoked by name was not getting passed to the script has been fixed.

	  inside a function defined with name() syntax could affect 
	  the invoking function has been fixed.
04-01-08  If a command name begins with ~, only filename completion will be

	  multiple word replacements with the . directive has been fixed.
04-01-06  Backspace characters are now handled correctly in prompt strings.
04-01-06 +The getopts builtin has been modified to accept numerical
	  arguments of size long long on systems that support this.
04-01-06  A bug in which unsetting all elements of an associative array
	  would cause it to be treated as an indexed array has been fixed.

	  delete the ending $ in certain cases has been fixed.
03-12-05  A bug in which the shell could hang when set -x tracing a command
	  when an invalid multibyte character is encountered has been fixed. 
03-12-05  On some systems, if the KEYBD trap is set, then commands that use
	  the meta key were not processed until return was hit.  This
	  has been fixed.

	  leader that could cause it to fail has been fixed.
03-12-05  A problem in which a shell could core dump after receiving a signal
	  that should cause it to terminate while it was in the process
	  of acquiring more space has been fixed.
03-12-05 +If ENV is not specified, the shell will default to $HOME/.kshrc
	  for interactive shells.

	  disabled after it triggered has been fixed. 
03-11-04  A bug in which using arithmetic prefix operators ++ or -- on a
	  non-lvalue could cause a core dump has been fixed.
03-11-04  A bug in which leading zeros were stripped from variable
	  expansions within arithmetic computation to avoid being treated
	  as octal constants when they should not have, has been fixed.
03-10-08  A bug introduced in ksh93o in which a large here document inside
	  a function definition could get corrupted has been fixed.

	  within a numerical expression has been fixed.
03-09-22  A bug in which a script without a leading #! could get executed
	  by /bin/sh rather than the current shell on some systems has
	  been fixed.
03-09-12 +To improve conformance with ksh88, leading zeros will be ignored
	  when getting the numerical value of a string variable so that
	  they will not be treated as octal constants.
03-09-03 +The builtin kill command now processes obsolete invocations
	  such as kill -1 -pid.
03-09-02  The restriction on modifying FPATH in a restricted shell (sh -r)
	  has been documented.
03-09-02 +The restricted shell (sh -r) has been modified to disallow
	  executing command -p.
03-08-07  A bug in which the KEYBD trap was not being invoked when
	  characters with the 8th bit set has been fixed.
03-08-02  A parser bug introduced in ksh93o which caused the character

	  part of the pattern has been fixed.
03-08-01 +The command -x option has been modified so that any trailing
	  arguments that do expand to a single word will be included
	  on each invocation, so that commands like command -x mv * dir

03-96-23  A bug in which ${X[@]:offset:len} could core dump when X
	  was unset has been fixed.
03-06-22 +The -x option was added to the command builtin.  If this
	  option is on, and the number of arguments would exceed ARG_MAX,
	  the command will be invoked multiple times with a subset of
	  the arguments.  For example, with alias grep='command -x grep,
	  any number of arguments can be specified.
03-06-14  A bug in which could cause a core dump on some systems with
	  vi and emacs editors with the MULTIBYTE option has been fixed.

	  during pathname expansion, any component that consists only of ** is
	  matches all files and any number of directory levels.
03-05-30  A bug in which the PATH search could give incorrect results when
	  run from directory foo and PATH contained .:foo:xxx has been fixed.
03-05-29 +Some changes were made to the code that displays the prompt in edit 
	  mode to better handle escape sequences in the prompt.
03-05-27  I added = to the list of characters that mark the beginning of
	  a word for edit completion so that filenames in assignments
	  can be completed.
03-05-20  A bug in which read -N could hang on some systems when reading
	  from a terminal or a pipe has been fixed.
03-05-19  A bug in which the output of uname from a command substitution
	  would go to the standard output of the invoking command when
	  uname was invoked with a non-standard option has been fixed.
03-05-19  A job control bug which would cause the shell to exit because 
	  it hadn't take back the terminal has been fixed.  The bug
	  could occur when running a function that contained a pipeline
	  whose last element was a function.

	  some elements would not be output when the name was a prefix
	  of another name in the compound variable has been fixed.
03-05-08  The last item in the ksh93o release on 03-01-02 has been
	  altered slightly to preserve the leading 0's when the
	  preceding character is a digit.  Thus, with typeset -LZ3 x=10,
	  $(( 1$x)) will be 1010 whereas $(( $x) will be 10.
03-04-25  A bug in which if x is a name reference, then nameref y=x.foo
	  did not follow x has been fixed.

03-03-18  --- Release ksh93o  ---
03-03-18 +A -N unary operator was added to test and [[...]] which returns
	  true if the file exists and the file has been modified since it
	  was last read.
03-03-18 +The TIMEFORMAT variable was added to control the format for
	  the time compound command.  The formatting description is
	  described in the man page.
03-03-06 +A -N n option was added to read which causes exactly n bytes
	  to be read unlike -n n which causes at most n bytes to be read.
03-03-03 +Three new shell variables were added.  The variable .sh.file
	  stores the full pathname of the file that the current command
	  was found in.  The variable .sh.fun names the current function
	  that is running.  The variable .sh.subshell contains the depth
	  of the current subshell or command substitution.
03-03-03 +When the DEBUG trap is executed, the current command line after
	  expansions is placed in the variable .sh.command.  The trap
	  is also now triggered before each iteration of a for, select,
	  and case command and before each assignment and redirection.
03-02-28 +Function definitions are no longer stored in the history file so
	  that set -o nolog no longer has any meaning.
03-02-28 +All function definitions can be displayed with typeset -f not
	  just those stored in the history file.  In addition, typeset +f
	  displays the function name followed by a comment containing the
	  line number and the path name for the file that defined this function.
03-02-28  A bug in which the value of $LINENO was not correct when executing
	  command contained inside mult-line command substitutions has been
	  fixed.
03-02-19 +Since some existing ksh88 scripts use the undocumented and
	  unintended ability to insert a : in front of the % and # parameter
	  expansion operators, ksh93 was modified to accept :% as equivalent
	  to % and :# as equivalent to # with ${name op word}.
03-02-14  A bug which could cause a core dump when reading from standard
	  error when standard error was a pty has been fixed.
03-02-14 +The shell arithmetic was modified to use long double on systems
	  that provide this data type.
03-02-09  A bug in which a function located in the first directory in FPATH
	  would not be found when the last component of PATH was . and the
	  current directory was one of the directories in PATH has been fixed.
03-02-07 +The trap and kill builtin commands now accept a leading SIG prefix
	  on the signal names as documented.
03-02-05  A bug in the expansion of ${var/$pattern}, when pattern contained
	  \[ has been fixed.
03-02-05  A bug in which .sh.match[n], n>0, was not being set for substring
	  matches with % and %% has been fixed.
03-01-15  A bug in which getopts did not work for numerical arguments specified
	  as n#var in the getopts string has been fixed.
03-01-09  A bug in which using ${.sh.match} multiple times could lead to
	  a memory exception has been fixed.
03-01-06  A bug in the expansion of ${var/pattern/$string} in the case that
	  $string contains \digit has been fixed. 
03-01-02 +A -P option was added for systems such as Solaris 8 that support
	  profile shell.
03-01-02  For backward compatibility with ksh88, arithmetic expansion
	  with ((...)) and let has been modified so that if x is a zero-filled
	  variable, $x will not be treated as an octal constant.

02-12-05  --- Release ksh93n+  ---
02-11-30  A bug that can show up in evaluating arithmetic statements that
	  are in an autoloaded function when the function is autoload from
	  another function has been fixed.
02-11-30  An optimization bug in which an expansion of the form ${!name.@},
	  which occurred inside a for or a while loop, when name is a name
	  reference, has been fixed.
02-11-18  A bug in which modifying array variables in a subshell could leave
	  side effects in the parent shell environment has been fixed.
02-11-18  A memory leak when unsetting an associative array has been fixed.
02-11-14 +The code to display compound objects was rewritten to make
	  it easier for runtime extensions to reuse this code.
02-11-14 +A change was made to allow runtime builtins to be notified when
	  a signal is received so that cleanup can be performed.
02-10-31 +User applications can now trap the ALRM signal.  Previously,
	  the ALRM signal was used internally and could not be used
	  by applications. 
02-10-31  A bug in which signals received while reading from a coprocess
	  for which traps were set was not handled correctly has been fixed.
02-10-31  A bug in which a file opened with exec inside a subshell could
	  be closed before the subshell completed has been fixed.
02-10-21  A bug in which setting PATH or FPATH inside a function might not
	  take effect has been fixed.
02-10-21  A bug which could cause a core dump when a local SECONDS variable
	  is defined in a function has been fixed.
02-10-15  A bug in which the associate array name operator ${!array[@]}
	  could return the same name multiple times has been fixed.
02-10-15  A bug in which the zero'th element of an associative array was
	  not getting set when an assignment was made without a subscript
	  specified has been fixed.

02-09-30  --- Release ksh93n  ---
02-09-30 +The maximum indexed array size was increased to 16Megs.
02-09-30  A bug which could cause a core dump when changing attributes
	  of associative array has been fixed.
02-09-30  A bug in which exporting an array variable would not export the
	  0-th element has been fixed.
02-09-30  A bug in which an array assignment of the form a=($a ...) would unset
	  'a' before the right hand side was evaluated has been fixed.
02-09-27  A bug in which the error message for ${var?message} when var was
	  null or unset did not contain the variable name var has been fixed.
02-09-27  A bug in which closing file descriptors 0 through 2 could
	  cause a subsequent here document to fail has been fixed. 
02-09-14  A bug in whence which occurs when the specified name contained
	  a / has been fixed.
02-09-14  A bug in the parser for strings of the form name$((expr))=value
	  has been fixed.
02-09-14  A for loop optimization bug in which the number of elements in
	  an array was treated as an invariant has been fixed.
02-09-09  A bug in which redirection or closing of a file descriptor between
	  3 and 9 could cause a subsequent here document to fail has been
	  fixed. 
02-09-09  A bug in which a background job was not removed from the job list
	  when a subshell completed has been fixed, for example (prog&). 
02-09-03  A bug in which an assignment of the form name=(integer x=3)
	  could be interpreted as an array assignment rather than a
	  compound variable assignment has been fixed.
02-08-19  A command completion bug which occurred on file systems that
	  are case insensitive has been fixed.
02-08-19  A bug which could lead to an exception on some systems (for
	  example FREEBSD) which occurred when setting PATH has been fixed.
02-08-11  A bug in arithmetic rounding in which a value input as a decimal
	  string would output as a rounded version of the string has
	  been fixed.
02-08-11  A bug in which the last character could be deleted from shell
	  traces and from whence when called from a multibyte locale
	  has been fixed.

	  is executed while a coprocess is running that has closed the
	  output pipe has been fixed.

	  corrupt memory for long command lines has been fixed.

02-06-17  --- Release ksh93n-  ---
02-06-17  A bug in which user defined macros could cause a core dump in
	  with MULTIBYTE mode has been fixed.
02-06-17  A bug in which printf format specifiers of the form %2$s were causing
	  a core dump has been fixed.
02-06-17  A bug in which setting stty to noecho mode did not prevent the
	  echoing of characters by ksh when emacs or viraw mode
	  was enabled has been fixed.
02-06-17  A bug in which background job completion could cause the sleep
	  builtin to terminate prematurely has been fixed.
02-06-17  A bug in which the shell could core dump if getopts was called
	  when the OPTIND variable contained a negative value has been fixed. 
02-06-10 +The edit mode prompt has been modified to handle escape sequences.  
02-06-10  A bug which occurred for interactive shells in which the builtin
	  cat command was used in command substitution on a file whose
	  size was larger than PIPE_BUF has been fixed.
02-06-10  A bug in which the trap on ERR was not being processed when
	  set inside a function has been fixed.
02-06-07  A bug in which function definitions could cause the history count
	  to be decremented by one (and even become negative) has been fixed.
02-06-05  A bug in read in which share mode could be enabled has been fixed.
02-05-28  A bug which could occur when the last command of a script was
	  a case statement and the action selected ended in ;& instead of ;;
	  has been fixed.
02-05-23  A bug with unary + introduced in ksh93k has been fixed.
02-05-07  A bug in substitutions of the form ${var/pattern/string} in which
	  a backslash was inserted in the replacement string when it contained
	  a special pattern character has been fixed.
02-05-01  A bug in the emacs edit mode which occurred in versions compiled
	  for multibyte character sets which occurred when a repeated search
	  was requested after a long line had been returned for the previous
	  search has been fixed.
02-04-02 +vi and emacs edit modes were modified so that tab completion is
	  disabled when invoked from the read built-in.

	  a for loop has been fixed.
02-02-06  A bug in which the ERR trap is not cleared for a script invoked
	  by name from within a function has been fixed.
02-01-08  A bug in which a shell script executed from within a subshell

	  the base was not 10.
01-11-26 +The default has compilation mode has been changes so that
	  viraw mode will always be on.

	  recursive functions with break or continue statements has been fixed.
01-09-25 +The exponentiation operator ** was added to the shell arithmetic
	  evaluation.  It has higher precedence than * and is left
	  associative.
01-09-25  The code was modified to use the ast multibyte macros
	  and functions for handing multibyte locales.
01-09-25 +The expansion ${parameter:offset:length} now handles negative
	  offsets which cause offsets to be measured from the end.
01-09-25  Some spelling errors in the documentation were corrected.
01-09-24 +The /dev/tcp/host/port and /dev/udp/host/port now allow
	  the ports to be specified by service name. 
01-09-24 +The change staring with ksh93g in which the the appropriate
	  library path variable is prepended with a corresponding library
	  directory has been modified.  With the new method, only the
	  library path defined in the file named .paths in the directory
	  where the executable is found will be modified.  See the
	  man page for more details.
01-09-23 +The .fpath file (see ksh93h) is no longer looked for in each
	  directory on the path to locate function directories.  The
	  file named .paths is used instead.
01-09-23  A bug in which IFS was not being restored after being changed in
	  a subshell has been fixed.
01-09-16 +With the vi and emacs edit modes, after a list of command

	  by preceding the = or M-= with a numeric parameter specifying
	  the position on the list.
01-09-16  A bug in ksh93l caused command completion not to find aliases
	  and functions.  Command listing from the edit mode was presented

01-09-13  Another bug in the optimization of for loops related to subshells
	  when traps were set has been fixed.
01-09-07  A change in ksh93l caused brace expansion to stop working

	  errors in recursive functions using local variables that
	  contained for loops has been fixed.
01-07-27  A bug in which IFS would be unset after a command substitution
	  inside a here document has been fixed.
01-07-26  To conform to the POSIX standard, if you invoked ksh name,
	  and name does not contain a /,  it will first try to run
	  one in the current directory whether it is executable or not
	  before doing a path search for an executable script.  Earlier
	  versions first checked for an executable script using the
	  PATH variable.
01-07-23  A bug in which unset -f invoked in a subshell could unset a
	  function defined in the parent has been fixed.
01-07-16  A bug in the optimization of for loops in ksh93l caused
	  name references to be treated as invariants has been fixed.
01-07-09  A bug in which a discipline function applied to a local variable
	  could cause a shell exception has been fixed.  Discipline
	  functions can only be specified for global variables.

	  \x{hex} have been added to ASCII-C strings and to printf format
	  strings.
01-05-20 +Patterns of the form {n}(pattern) and {m,n}(pattern) are now
	  recognized.  The first form matches exactly n of pattern whereas,
	  the second form matches from m to n instances of pattern.
01-05-20 +The shell allows *-(pattern), +-(pattern),  ?-(pattern),
	  {m,n}-(pattern}, and @-(pattern) to cause the minimal
	  match of pattern to be selected whenever possible rather
	  than the maximal (greedy) match. 
01-05-20 +The character class [:word:] has been added to patterns.
	  The word class is the union of [:alnum:] and the character _.
01-05-20 +Inside (...) pattern groups, the \ character is now treated
	  specially even when in an enclosing character class.  The
	  sequences, \w, \d, \s are equivalent to the character classes
	  word, digit, and space respectively.  The sequences \W, \D,
	  and \S are their complement sets. 
01-05-20 +The shell now recognizes pattern groups of the form
	  ~(options:pattern) where options or :pattern can be omitted.
	  Options use the letters + and - to enable and disable options
	  respectively.  The option letters g (greedy), i (ignore case)
	  are used to cause maximal matching and to cause case
	  insensitive matching respectively.  If :pattern is also
	  specified, these options are only in effect while this
	  pattern is being processed.  Otherwise, these options remain
	  in effect until the end of the pattern group that they are contained
	  in or until another ~(...) is encountered.  These pattern groups
	  are not counted with respect to group numbering.
01-05-14  When edit completion, expansion, or listing occurs in the
	  middle of a quoted string, the leading quote is ignored when
	  performing the completion, expansion, or listing.
01-05-14  A small memory leak from subshells has been fixed.
01-05-10  A bug in which open files were not restored after a subshell
	  that had used exec to replace a file has been fixed. 
01-05-10 +Redirection to a null file name now generates an error message. 
01-05-09  The shell now rejects some invalid parameter substitutions that
	  were previously processed in undefined ways.
01-05-09  A bug in which the output of select was not flushed before the
	  read when input did not come from the terminal has been fixed. 
01-05-08  A bug in which job ids would not be freed for interactive shells
	  when subshells ran built-ins in the background has been fixed.
01-05-08 +The FPATH variable now requires an explicit . to cause the
	  current directory to be treated as a function directory. 
01-05-08  A bug in read -n when echo mode was disabled has been fixed.
01-05-07  A bug in which function definitions could be listed as part
	  of the history has been fixed.
01-04-30 +This release uses a new and often much faster pattern matcher than
	  earlier releases.
01-04-30 +An optimizer now eliminates invariant parameter expansions from
	  for while and until loops.
01-04-30 +The variable .sh.match is set after each pattern match (# % or /)
	  in a variable substitution.  The variable .sh.match is an
	  indexed array with element 0 being the complete match. 
	  The array is only valid until the next subsequent pattern
	  match or until the value of the variable changes which ever
	  comes first.
01-04-30 +A self generating man page has been added to shcomp.  Also,
	  shcomp now stops compiling when it finds an exit or exec
	  command and copies the remainder so that it can be used
	  for standard input.
01-04-30 +The shcomp command was modified so that it can work in an
	  EBCIDIC environment and that binary scripts are portable
	  across environments.
01-04-30  A bug in the handling of a trailing : in PATH has been fixed.
01-04-30  A bug in which the builtin version of a command would get invoked
	  even though the full pathname for the command was specified
	  has been fixed.
01-04-30  A bug in which read would loose the last character when
	  reading the last line of a file that did not contain a new-line
	  character has been fixed.
01-04-23  A bug on some systems in which in vi mode the end of file
	  character and end of line character could be swapped has
	  been fixed.
01-04-23  A bug on some systems in which invoking a shell script that
	  did not have execute permission could set the exit value to
	  127 rather than 126 has been fixed.
01-04-20  A bug in which read -n from a pipe would block if fewer than
	  n characters was received has been fixed.
01-04-09  A bug in which invalid patterns, for example, ) by itself,
	  was not treated as a string has been fixed so that if i=')',
	  then [[ $i == $i ]] is true.
01-04-09 +The shell arithmetic now interprets C character constants.
01-04-09  A bug in which a non-zero return from a function defined
	  with the function reserved word did not trigger the ERR
	  trap or exit with set -e has been fixed.
01-04-02  A bug on some systems, in which characters above 127 were
	  not displayed correctly in vi or emacs edit mode has been fixed.
01-04-02  A bug on some systems, introduced in the 'k' point release, in
	  which the erase character in viraw mode was moving the cursor
	  to the left without erasing the character has been fixed.
01-04-02  On some systems the wcwith() function was returning a wrong
	  value for characters and caused characters to be displayed
	  incorrectly from the shell edit modes.  A work around for
	  this problem has been added. 
01-03-26  A bug in which valid scripts could produce syntax errors
	  when run with locales that considered characters such as "'"
	  to be space characters has been fixed.
01-03-20  A bug in which an syntax error in an arithmetic expression
	  entered interactively could cause the shell to go into
	  an infinite loop outputting the error message has been fixed.
01-03-10 +ksh93 accepts -l as a synonym for -L in test on systems for
	  which /bin/test -l tests for symbolic links.
01-03-10  A bug in parsing scripts in which { and } are used in place of
	  in and esac in case statements embedded in compound commands
	  has been fixed.  Use of { and } for in and esac is obsolete.
01-03-06  A bug in which an argument of the form foo=bar was not
	  being passed correctly to a traced function whose name
	  was foo has been fixed.
01-03-02  Using $(trap -p name) did not print the name of the current
	  trap setting for trap name.
01-02-26  Exported floating point variables gave incorrect results
	  when passing them to ksh88.  This has been fixed.
01-02-25  A race condition in which a coprocess which completed too quickly
	  would not allow subsequent coprocesses to start has been fixed.

	  inadvertently been omitted.
01-02-20  The + was not being displayed during an execution trace
	  with the += assignment operator.
01-02-19  The error message which occurs when the interpreter name
	  defined on the #! line does not exist is more informative.
01-02-19  A bug in which $0 would not be set correctly when a
	  script with #! was invoked by full pathname from the
	  directory of the script has been fixed.
01-02-19  A shell script did not always pick up tty mode changes
	  made by external commands such as stty which could
	  effect the behavior of read.
01-02-19  The -u, -g, and -k unary tests did not give the correct
	  results when used with negation and this has been fixed.

01-02-05  --- Release ksh93k+  ---
01-02-05  The sequence \<newline> inside $'...' was not incrementing
	  the line count and this has been fixed.
01-02-05 +Modified expansion of "${@-}" so that if no arguments are set
	  it results in null string rather than nothing.
01-02-02  memory leak problem with local variables in functions fixed.
01-01-25 +allow arithmetic expressions with float%int and treat them
	  as ((int)float)%int rather than as an error.

01-01-17 +ksh now handles the case in which a here document in command
	  substitution $() is terminated by the trailing ).  Previously,

	  jobs run in a script has been fixed.
00-11-21  A bug in integer arrays in which the number of elements is
	  incorrect when the ++ operator is applied to a non-existing
	  element has been fixed.  For example, integer x; ((x[3]++)).
00-11-20  A timing bug in which the shell could reset the terminal
	  group to the wrong value in the case that the a new process
	  changes the terminal group during startup has been fixed.

00-10-27  --- Release ksh93k  ---
00-10-27  Using tab for completion now works only when applied
	  after a non-blank character at the end of the current line.
	  In other case a tab is inserted.
00-10-27  A bug in the emacs edit mode for ^X^E has been fixed.
	  The ^X^E sequence is supposed to invoke the full editor

	  been fixed.
00-10-18 +The output format for indexed arrays in compound variables

          has been fixed.
00-01-28  When a symbolic link was specified as the name of
          the script to invoke by name, the value of $0 was
          set to the real file name rather than the link name
          in some cases and this has been fixed.
00-01-28  A bug in which the precision given as an argument
	  to printf was not working has been fixed.

99-03-31  --- Release ksh93h  ---
99-03-31 +The PATH search algorithm has been modified to look
	  for a file named .fpath in each bin directory and if

	  it cannot find the command in that directory.
99-03-31 +When performing pathname expansion, the shell checks
	  to see whether each directory it reads is case sensitive
	  or not, and performs the matching accordingly.

	  be that of the last command to fail, or zero if
	  all complete successfully.
98-04-30 +The name-value pair library uses the cdt library rather
	  than the hash library.  This change should be transparent
	  to applications.
98-04-30 +On the U/WIN version for Window 95 and Windows NT,
          when a directory beginning with a letter followed by
