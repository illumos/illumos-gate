# By default, mapfilechk operates on any file in the workspace
# in which the final path segment:
#	- Contains the word 'mapfile'
#	- Begins with 'map.'
#	- Ends with '.map'
# as long as it does not have a .c or .h suffix.
#
# This file provides an exception mechanism for specifying files
# that match this pattern that should be skipped.
