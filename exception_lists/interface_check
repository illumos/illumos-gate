# This file provides exceptions to the usual rules applied to shared
# objects by interface_check. All strings are Perl regular expressions
# that are compared to file names. In addition to the standard Perl
# syntax, there is one extension:
#
#	MACH(dir)
#
# is expanded into a regular expression that matches the given
# directory, or a 64-bit subdirectory of the directory with the
# name of a 64-bit architecture. For example, MACH(lib) will match
# any of the following:
#
#	lib
#	lib/amd64
#	lib/sparcv9


# Shared objects underneath these parts of the tree are taken to be plugins.
# Plugins are not required to have versioned file names, and are not required
# to be internally versioned.
