Enter the pathname of the file folder that will be the
current folder when this program is invoked.  For some
applications, you may want all of the files that the
program creates to be in the same file folder.  If you
don't specify a value for this field, the default when
the program is executed is the current open file folder.

The default is the working directory for the program 
you are modifying.
